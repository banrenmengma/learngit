1
00:00:00,018 --> 00:00:01,020
In the last video, we talked

2
00:00:01,058 --> 00:00:02,095
about the process of evaluating

3
00:00:03,079 --> 00:00:05,078
an anomaly detection algorithm and

4
00:00:05,091 --> 00:00:06,098
there we started to use some

5
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,081
labelled data, with examples

6
00:00:08,088 --> 00:00:10,015
that we knew were either anomalous

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,016
or not anomalous, with y equals 1 or y equals 0.

8
00:00:14,068 --> 00:00:15,038
So the question then arises, if

9
00:00:15,068 --> 00:00:17,069
we have this labeled data,

10
00:00:18,012 --> 00:00:19,062
we have some examples that are

11
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:20,083
known to be anomalies and some

12
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:21,085
that are known not to be not

13
00:00:22,008 --> 00:00:23,053
anomalies, why don't we

14
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:25,057
just use a supervised learning algorithm,

15
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:26,078
so why don't we just use

16
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,035
logistic regression or a neural

17
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:29,076
network to try to

18
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:31,026
learn directly from our labeled

19
00:00:31,055 --> 00:00:34,011
data, to predict whether y equals one or y equals zero.

20
00:00:34,089 --> 00:00:35,089
In this video, I'll try to

21
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:37,017
share with you some of

22
00:00:37,035 --> 00:00:38,082
the thinking and some guidelines for

23
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:40,060
when you should probably use an

24
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:42,015
anomaly detection algorithm and when

25
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:43,050
it might be more fruitful to consider

26
00:00:43,092 --> 00:00:45,038
using a supervised learning algorithm.

27
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:48,095
This slide shows, what are

28
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,013
the settings under which you should

29
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:52,036
maybe use anomaly detection versus

30
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:54,059
when supervised learning might be more fruitful.

31
00:00:56,003 --> 00:00:57,043
If you have a problem with a

32
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,082
very small number of positive

33
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:01,078
examples, and remember examples of

34
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:03,000
y equals one are the

35
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,051
anomalous examples, then

36
00:01:06,017 --> 00:01:08,015
you might consider using an anomaly detection algorithm inset.

37
00:01:09,026 --> 00:01:10,043
So having 0 to 20,

38
00:01:10,059 --> 00:01:12,073
maybe up to 50 positive examples,

39
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:15,018
might be pretty typical, and usually,

40
00:01:15,068 --> 00:01:16,081
we have such a small set

41
00:01:17,012 --> 00:01:18,034
of positive examples,

42
00:01:19,026 --> 00:01:20,017
we are going to save the positive

43
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:21,053
examples just for the cross

44
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:24,043
validation sets and test sets.

45
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,012
In contrast, in a typical

46
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:28,056
normal anomaly detection setting,

47
00:01:29,034 --> 00:01:30,062
we will often have a relatively

48
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:32,034
large number of negative examples,

49
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,029
of these normal examples of

50
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,070
normal aircraft engines.

51
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:38,090
And we can then use this very

52
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,023
large number of negative examples,

53
00:01:41,046 --> 00:01:42,051
with which to fit the model

54
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,009
p of x.  And so, there is

55
00:01:44,018 --> 00:01:45,093
this idea in many anomaly detection

56
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:48,051
applications, you have

57
00:01:48,076 --> 00:01:50,021
very few positive examples, and

58
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:52,054
lots of negative examples, and when

59
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:54,095
we are doing the process of

60
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:57,051
estimating p of x, of fitting all those Gaussian parameters,

61
00:01:58,065 --> 00:02:00,068
we need only negative examples to do that.

62
00:02:00,084 --> 00:02:01,068
So if you have a lot of negative data,

63
00:02:02,014 --> 00:02:04,031
we can still fit to p of x pretty well.

64
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:07,009
In contrast, for supervised learning,

65
00:02:07,076 --> 00:02:08,078
more typically we would have

66
00:02:09,018 --> 00:02:10,081
a reasonably large number of

67
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,037
both positive and negative examples.

68
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,096
And so this is one

69
00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:16,024
way to look at your problem

70
00:02:16,077 --> 00:02:17,086
and decide if you should use

71
00:02:18,024 --> 00:02:20,018
an anomaly detection algorithm or a supervised learning algorithm.

72
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:24,075
Here is another way people often think about anomaly detection algorithms.

73
00:02:25,053 --> 00:02:26,088
So, for anomaly detection applications

74
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,088
often there are many

75
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:30,059
different types of anomalies.

76
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:31,077
So think about aircraft engines.

77
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:34,068
You know there are so many different ways for aircraft engines to go wrong.

78
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:36,097
Right? There are so many things that could go wrong that could break an aircraft engine.

79
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:40,008
And so, if that's the

80
00:02:40,012 --> 00:02:40,093
case and you have a pretty small

81
00:02:41,013 --> 00:02:43,056
set of positive examples, then

82
00:02:44,043 --> 00:02:46,075
it can be difficult for

83
00:02:47,058 --> 00:02:48,037
an algorithm to learn from your small

84
00:02:48,074 --> 00:02:50,012
set of positive examples what the anomalies look like.

85
00:02:50,018 --> 00:02:51,087
And in particular,

86
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,005
you know, future anomalies may look

87
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:55,075
nothing like the ones you've seen so far.

88
00:02:56,005 --> 00:02:57,053
So maybe in your set

89
00:02:57,078 --> 00:02:59,003
of positive examples, maybe you

90
00:02:59,018 --> 00:02:59,074
had seen 5 or 10, or 20

91
00:02:59,094 --> 00:03:02,096
different ways that an aircraft engine could go wrong.

92
00:03:03,078 --> 00:03:05,059
But maybe tomorrow, you

93
00:03:05,078 --> 00:03:07,011
need to detect a totally

94
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:08,087
new set, a totally new

95
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:10,062
type of anomaly, a totally

96
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:12,016
new way for an aircraft

97
00:03:12,056 --> 00:03:13,087
engine to be broken that

98
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:15,065
you have just never seen before,

99
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,000
and if that is the case,

100
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:18,046
then it might be more

101
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,002
promising to just model

102
00:03:20,047 --> 00:03:21,077
the negative examples, with a

103
00:03:21,096 --> 00:03:23,062
sort of a Gaussian model

104
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:24,094
P of X. Rather than try

105
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:26,025
too hard to model the positive

106
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:27,084
examples, because, you know,

107
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:29,031
tomorrow's anomaly may be

108
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,068
nothing like the ones you've seen so far.

109
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,063
In contrast, in some other

110
00:03:34,078 --> 00:03:36,016
problems you have enough

111
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:37,078
positive examples for an algorithm

112
00:03:38,072 --> 00:03:40,084
to get a sense of what the positive examples are like.

113
00:03:40,097 --> 00:03:42,086
And in particular, if you

114
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,027
think that future positive examples

115
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:45,068
are likely to be similar

116
00:03:46,012 --> 00:03:46,097
to ones in the training set,

117
00:03:47,066 --> 00:03:49,009
then in that setting it might

118
00:03:49,022 --> 00:03:51,071
be more reasonable to have a supervised learning algorithm,

119
00:03:52,055 --> 00:03:53,038
that looks at a lot of

120
00:03:53,052 --> 00:03:54,075
the positive examples, looks at a

121
00:03:54,093 --> 00:03:56,053
lot of the negative examples, and

122
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:58,097
uses that to try to distinguish between positives and negatives.

123
00:04:01,062 --> 00:04:02,078
So hopefully this gives you

124
00:04:02,087 --> 00:04:04,018
a sense of if you have

125
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:05,068
a specific problem you should think

126
00:04:05,094 --> 00:04:07,080
about using the anomaly

127
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:09,044
detection algorithm or a supervised learning algorithm.

128
00:04:11,011 --> 00:04:12,034
And the key difference really is,

129
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,087
that in anomaly detection, after

130
00:04:14,002 --> 00:04:15,003
we have such a small

131
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:17,019
number of positive examples that there

132
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,063
is not possible, for a learning

133
00:04:19,032 --> 00:04:21,081
algorithm to learn that much from the positive examples.

134
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:23,043
And so what we do instead,

135
00:04:23,088 --> 00:04:25,005
is take a large set of

136
00:04:25,023 --> 00:04:26,042
negative examples, and have it just

137
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:28,006
learned a lot, learned p

138
00:04:28,023 --> 00:04:29,030
of x from just the negative

139
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,073
examples of the normal aircraft engines, say.

140
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:33,048
And we reserve the small

141
00:04:33,063 --> 00:04:36,074
number of positive examples for evaluating our algorithm

142
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:39,068
to use in either the cross validation sets or the test sets.

143
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,037
And just as a side comment about

144
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:43,097
these many different types of

145
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:45,049
anomalies, you know, in

146
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,091
some earlier videos we talked

147
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:49,006
about the email SPAM examples.

148
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:51,050
In those examples, there are

149
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,044
actually many different types of SPAM email.

150
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,075
The SPAM email is trying to

151
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:57,064
sell you things spam email, trying to steal your passwords,

152
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:01,006
this is called fishing emails, and many different types of SPAM emails.

153
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:03,049
But for the SPAM problem, we usually

154
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:05,066
have enough examples of spam

155
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,039
email to see, you know,

156
00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:08,064
most of these different types of

157
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:10,019
SPAM email, because we have a

158
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:11,064
large set of examples of

159
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:13,005
SPAM, and that's why we

160
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:14,080
usually think of SPAM as

161
00:05:14,098 --> 00:05:16,050
a supervised learning setting, even

162
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,038
though, you know, there may be

163
00:05:17,052 --> 00:05:19,023
many different types of SPAM.

164
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:23,017
And so, if we look at

165
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,093
some applications of anomaly detection

166
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,029
versus supervised learning, we'll find

167
00:05:27,048 --> 00:05:29,027
that, in fraud detection, if

168
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,004
you have many different types

169
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:32,050
of ways for people to

170
00:05:32,068 --> 00:05:34,012
try to commit fraud, and a

171
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:35,073
relevantly small training set, a

172
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:37,050
small number of fraudulent users

173
00:05:37,092 --> 00:05:40,030
on your website, then I would use an anomaly detection algorithm.

174
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:42,051
I should say, if you

175
00:05:42,064 --> 00:05:44,056
have, if you are very a

176
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:46,081
major online retailer, and

177
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:48,017
if you actually have had a

178
00:05:48,032 --> 00:05:49,023
lot of people try to commit

179
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:50,042
fraud on your website, so if

180
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:51,033
you actually have a lot of

181
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,075
examples where y equals 1, then

182
00:05:53,097 --> 00:05:55,041
you know, sometimes fraud detection

183
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:58,002
could actually shift over to the supervised learning column.

184
00:05:58,085 --> 00:06:01,000
But, if you

185
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,043
haven't seen that many

186
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:04,048
examples of users doing

187
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:05,072
strange things on your website

188
00:06:05,092 --> 00:06:07,097
then, more frequently, fraud detection

189
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,073
is actually treated as an

190
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:12,006
anomaly detection algorithm, rather than one of the supervised learning algorithm.

191
00:06:14,013 --> 00:06:15,016
Other examples, we talked about

192
00:06:15,031 --> 00:06:16,081
manufacturing already, hopefully you'll

193
00:06:16,094 --> 00:06:18,023
see more normal examples,

194
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:19,083
not that many anomalies.

195
00:06:20,051 --> 00:06:21,056
But then again, for some manufacturing

196
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:23,089
processes, if you're

197
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:25,068
manufacturing very large volumes

198
00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:26,077
and you've seen a lot

199
00:06:27,023 --> 00:06:29,022
of bad examples, maybe manufacturing

200
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:31,068
could shift to the supervised learning column as well.

201
00:06:32,062 --> 00:06:33,068
But, if you haven't seen that

202
00:06:33,094 --> 00:06:35,063
many bad examples of

203
00:06:35,082 --> 00:06:38,013
the old products, then I'll do this anomaly detection.

204
00:06:39,018 --> 00:06:40,029
Monitoring machines in the

205
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:42,044
data center, again similar

206
00:06:42,087 --> 00:06:44,005
sorts of arguments apply.

207
00:06:45,027 --> 00:06:46,064
Whereas, email SPAM

208
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,094
classification, weather prediction, and classifying

209
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,057
cancers, if you have

210
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:52,085
equal numbers of positive and

211
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:53,092
negative examples, a lot of you

212
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,055
have many examples of your

213
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:56,077
positive and your negative

214
00:06:57,002 --> 00:06:57,087
examples, then, we would tend to

215
00:06:58,007 --> 00:07:00,062
treat all of these as supervised learning problems.

216
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,050
So, hopefully, that gives you

217
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,060
a sense of what are the

218
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:07,005
properties of a learning

219
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:08,098
problem that would cause you to

220
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:10,041
treat it as an anomaly

221
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:12,066
detention problem verses a supervised learning

222
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:14,025
problem.

223
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:16,001
And for many of the problems that are

224
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:17,081
faced by various technology companies

225
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:19,077
and so on, we actually are

226
00:07:19,086 --> 00:07:20,089
in these settings where we have

227
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,031
very few or sometimes zero

228
00:07:24,006 --> 00:07:25,008
positive training examples,

229
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,082
maybe there are so many

230
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:28,041
different types of anomalies that we've never

231
00:07:28,052 --> 00:07:29,081
seen them before, and for those

232
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:31,089
sorts of problems, very often,

233
00:07:32,043 --> 00:07:33,057
the algorithm that is used

234
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,017
is an anomaly detection algorithm.
