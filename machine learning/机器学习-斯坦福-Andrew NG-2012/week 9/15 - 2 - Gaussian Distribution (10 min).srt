1
00:00:00,024 --> 00:00:01,040
In this video, I'd like to

2
00:00:01,056 --> 00:00:03,058
talk about the Gaussian distribution, which

3
00:00:03,083 --> 00:00:05,080
is also called the normal distribution.

4
00:00:07,042 --> 00:00:08,093
In case you're already intimately

5
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:11,098
familiar with the Gaussian distribution, it is

6
00:00:12,016 --> 00:00:13,081
probably okay to skip this video.

7
00:00:14,064 --> 00:00:15,089
But if you're not sure or

8
00:00:15,097 --> 00:00:16,089
if it's been a while since you've

9
00:00:17,003 --> 00:00:18,076
worked with a Gaussian distribution or the normal

10
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:20,048
distribution then please do

11
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,096
watch this video all the way to the end.

12
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:24,026
And in the video after this,

13
00:00:24,048 --> 00:00:25,073
we'll start applying the Gaussian

14
00:00:25,098 --> 00:00:28,089
distribution to developing an anomaly detection algorithm.

15
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:33,031
Let's say x is a

16
00:00:33,053 --> 00:00:36,046
real value random variable, so x is a real number.

17
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:39,007
If the probability distribution of

18
00:00:39,027 --> 00:00:41,015
x is Gaussian, it

19
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,071
would mean Mu and variant

20
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,035
sigma squared, then we'll

21
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:47,060
write this as x the

22
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:49,027
random variable tilde.

23
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,029
That's this little tilde

24
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:59,052
as distributed as and then

25
00:00:59,072 --> 00:01:01,054
to denote the Gaussian Distribution, sometimes

26
00:01:02,007 --> 00:01:03,092
you're going to write script n, parentheses

27
00:01:04,082 --> 00:01:07,014
Mu, sigma squared.

28
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:09,031
So, this script's end stands for

29
00:01:09,053 --> 00:01:10,092
normal, since Gaussian and normal

30
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,017
distribution, they mean the same

31
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,065
phase of synonymous and a

32
00:01:14,078 --> 00:01:16,018
Gussian distribution is parameterized

33
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:18,043
by 2 parameters, by a

34
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:20,093
mean parameter which we

35
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:22,076
denote Mu, and a variance

36
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,001
parameter, which we denote by sigma squared.

37
00:01:26,012 --> 00:01:27,026
If we pluck the Gaussian distribution

38
00:01:27,098 --> 00:01:30,009
or Gaussian probability density, it

39
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:31,076
will look like the bell shaped

40
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,081
curve, which you may have seen before.

41
00:01:36,023 --> 00:01:37,085
And so, this bell-shaped curve

42
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,034
is parameterized by those 2 parameters Mu and sigma.

43
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:42,067
And the location of the

44
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:44,023
center of this bell-shaped curve

45
00:01:44,057 --> 00:01:46,095
is the mean Mu, and the

46
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:48,015
width of this bell-shaped curve,

47
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:51,001
so it's roughly that, is

48
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:52,096
the, this parameter

49
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,039
sigma, is also called one standard deviation.

50
00:01:56,054 --> 00:01:58,034
And so, this specifies the

51
00:01:58,053 --> 00:01:59,062
probability of x taking

52
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,098
on different values, so x

53
00:02:01,018 --> 00:02:02,073
taking on values, you know

54
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,076
in the middle here is pretty high

55
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:05,029
since the Gaussian density here

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,048
is pretty high whereas

57
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,053
x taking on values further and

58
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:10,031
further away will be diminishing

59
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:12,059
in probability. Finally, just

60
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,077
for completeness, let me write

61
00:02:14,002 --> 00:02:15,025
out the formula for the Gaussian

62
00:02:16,008 --> 00:02:17,031
distribution so the property

63
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,078
of x and I'll

64
00:02:19,093 --> 00:02:20,093
sometimes write this instead of

65
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:22,006
p of x, I'm going

66
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:22,096
to write this as p of

67
00:02:23,034 --> 00:02:24,093
x semicolon Mu comma sigma squared.

68
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,075
And so this denotes that the probability of

69
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,066
x is parametrized by

70
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,065
the two parameters Mu and sigma squared.

71
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:33,033
And the formula for the

72
00:02:33,037 --> 00:02:34,075
Gaussian density is this,

73
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:37,086
1 over 2pi, sigma e

74
00:02:38,006 --> 00:02:41,050
to the negative x minus Mu squared over 2 sigma squared.

75
00:02:41,087 --> 00:02:45,097
So there's no need to memorize this

76
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:47,053
formula, you know, this

77
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:49,040
is just the formula for the

78
00:02:49,053 --> 00:02:51,002
bell-shaped curve over here on the left.

79
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:53,009
There's no need to memorize it and

80
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:53,099
if you ever need to use this,

81
00:02:54,018 --> 00:02:56,046
you can always look this up.

82
00:02:56,053 --> 00:02:57,044
And so that figure on the

83
00:02:57,074 --> 00:02:58,041
left, that is what you get

84
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,009
if you take a fixed

85
00:03:00,028 --> 00:03:01,019
value of Mu and a

86
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:04,006
fixed value of sigma and

87
00:03:04,044 --> 00:03:06,013
you plot p of x. So this

88
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:07,083
curve here, this is really

89
00:03:08,038 --> 00:03:10,000
p of x plotted as a

90
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:11,053
function of x, you know,

91
00:03:11,063 --> 00:03:15,096
for a fixed value of Mu

92
00:03:16,018 --> 00:03:18,077
and of sigma squared sigma squared, that's called the variance.

93
00:03:19,094 --> 00:03:22,027
And sometimes it's easier to think in terms of sigma.

94
00:03:22,094 --> 00:03:24,072
So sigma is called the

95
00:03:25,012 --> 00:03:27,084
standard deviation and it,

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,063
so it specifies the

97
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,031
width of this Gaussian probability

98
00:03:31,072 --> 00:03:33,012
density whereas the square

99
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:34,049
of sigma, so sigma squared, is

100
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:36,083
called the variance. Let's look

101
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,097
at some examples of what the Gaussian distribution looks like.

102
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,028
If Mu equals zero, sigma equals 1.

103
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:44,072
Then we have a Gaussian distribution

104
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:48,000
that is centered around zero, because that's Mu.

105
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:50,056
And the width of this Gaussian, so

106
00:03:50,072 --> 00:03:53,061
that's one standard deviation is sigma over there.

107
00:03:55,013 --> 00:03:56,033
Let's look at some examples of

108
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,077
Gaussians. If Mu

109
00:03:58,096 --> 00:04:00,075
is equal to zero it equals 1.

110
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:02,015
Then that corresponds to a

111
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:04,003
Gaussian distribution that is centered

112
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,037
at zero since Mu is zero.

113
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,031
And the width of this Gaussian

114
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:12,056
is Gaussian thus controlled

115
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,043
by sigma by that variance parameter sigma.

116
00:04:16,085 --> 00:04:17,038
Here's another example.

117
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,026
Let's say Mu is equal to

118
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:23,067
zero and sigma is equal to one-half.

119
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:26,029
So the standard deviation is

120
00:04:26,052 --> 00:04:27,064
one-half and the variance

121
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:29,055
sigma squared would therefore be

122
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,060
the square of 0.5 would be 0.25.

123
00:04:33,068 --> 00:04:34,091
And in that case the Gaussian distribution,

124
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,004
the Gaussian probability density looks

125
00:04:37,018 --> 00:04:39,049
like this, is also centered at zero.

126
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:41,041
But now the width of

127
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,025
this is much smaller because

128
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:45,017
the smaller variance, the

129
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,098
width of this Gaussian density

130
00:04:47,044 --> 00:04:49,035
is roughly half as wide.

131
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:51,070
But because this is a

132
00:04:51,097 --> 00:04:53,058
probability distribution, the area under

133
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,085
the curve, that is the shaded

134
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:56,079
area there, that area

135
00:04:57,018 --> 00:04:58,081
must integrate to 1.

136
00:04:58,081 --> 00:05:00,050
This is a property of probability distributions.

137
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:02,068
And so, you know, this

138
00:05:02,082 --> 00:05:04,052
is a much taller Gaussian density because

139
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:06,005
it's half as wide, with

140
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:08,014
half the standard deviation, but it's twice as tall.

141
00:05:09,012 --> 00:05:11,050
Another example, if sigma is

142
00:05:11,063 --> 00:05:12,054
equal to 2, then you

143
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:14,087
get a much fatter, or much wider Gaussian density.

144
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:17,008
And so here, the sigma

145
00:05:17,037 --> 00:05:19,030
parameter controls that this

146
00:05:19,062 --> 00:05:21,000
Gaussian density has a wider width.

147
00:05:21,093 --> 00:05:23,018
And once again, the area under

148
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,038
the curve, that is this shaded

149
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:26,072
area, you know, it always integrates to 1.

150
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:28,017
That's a property of probability

151
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,027
distributions, and because it's

152
00:05:30,048 --> 00:05:31,093
wider, it's also half as

153
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:36,063
tall, in order to just integrate to the same thing.

154
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:37,051
And finally, one last example would be,

155
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,098
if we now changed the Mu

156
00:05:39,012 --> 00:05:40,066
parameters as well, then instead

157
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,031
of being centered at zero, we

158
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,083
now we have a Gaussian distribution

159
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:46,081
that is centered at three, because

160
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,074
this shifts over the entire Gaussian distribution.

161
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,004
Next, lets take about the parameter estimation problem.

162
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,056
So what is the parameter estimation problem?

163
00:05:57,051 --> 00:05:58,035
Let's say we have a data set

164
00:05:58,085 --> 00:06:00,018
of m examples, so x1

165
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:01,047
through x(m), and let's say

166
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,025
each of these examples is a real number.

167
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:05,051
Here in the figure, I've plotted an

168
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:06,038
example of a data set,

169
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:08,038
so the horizontal axis is the

170
00:06:08,057 --> 00:06:09,043
x axis and, you know, I

171
00:06:09,056 --> 00:06:12,029
have a range of examples of x and I've just plotted them

172
00:06:12,056 --> 00:06:15,006
on this figure here.

173
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:17,027
And the parameter estimation problem is, let's

174
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,075
say I suspect that these examples

175
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:21,016
came from a Gaussian distribution so

176
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:24,056
let's say I suspect that each of my example x(i) was distributed.

177
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,093
That's what this tilde thing means.

178
00:06:27,058 --> 00:06:28,051
Thus, I suspect that each of

179
00:06:28,057 --> 00:06:30,022
these examples was distributed according

180
00:06:30,075 --> 00:06:32,018
to a normal distribution or

181
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,006
Gaussian distribution with some

182
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,020
parameter Mu and some parameter sigma squared.

183
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:39,056
But I don't know what the values of these parameters are.

184
00:06:40,081 --> 00:06:42,036
The problem with parameter estimation is,

185
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:44,048
given my data set I want

186
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,072
to figure out, I want to

187
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:46,083
estimate, what are the

188
00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:48,047
values of Mu and sigma squared.

189
00:06:49,062 --> 00:06:50,056
So, if you're given a

190
00:06:50,063 --> 00:06:51,066
data set like this, you know,

191
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:54,005
it looks like maybe, if I

192
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:56,020
estimate what Gaussian distribution the

193
00:06:56,035 --> 00:06:59,000
data came from, maybe that

194
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:01,076
might be roughly the Gaussian distribution

195
00:07:02,027 --> 00:07:04,041
it came from, with Mu

196
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,035
being the center of the distribution and

197
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:11,068
sigma the standard deviation controlling the width of this Gaussian distribution.

198
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:12,081
It seems like a reasonable

199
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:15,027
fit to the data, because, you know, it

200
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:16,087
looks the data has

201
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:18,091
a very high probability of being

202
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:20,058
in the central region, low probability of

203
00:07:21,063 --> 00:07:24,072
being further out, low probability of being further out, and so on.

204
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,076
And so, maybe this is

205
00:07:25,088 --> 00:07:27,036
a reasonable estimate of

206
00:07:28,001 --> 00:07:29,092
Mu and of sigma squared,

207
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,081
that is, if it corresponds to

208
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:33,097
a Gaussian distribution, that then looks like this.

209
00:07:35,064 --> 00:07:36,033
So, what I'm going to

210
00:07:36,043 --> 00:07:37,055
do is write out the

211
00:07:37,066 --> 00:07:39,008
formulas, the standard formulas

212
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:40,092
for estimating the parameters from

213
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:43,048
Mu and sigma squared.

214
00:07:44,011 --> 00:07:44,086
The way we are going to

215
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:47,013
estimate Mu is going to

216
00:07:47,037 --> 00:07:48,085
be just the average

217
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:50,062
of my example.

218
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,018
So Mu is the mean parameter,

219
00:07:52,075 --> 00:07:53,033
so I'm going to take my

220
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:54,035
training set, take my m

221
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:56,019
examples and average them.

222
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:58,012
And that just gives me the center of this distribution.

223
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:01,067
How about sigma squared?

224
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:03,011
Well the variance, I'll just

225
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:04,088
write out the standard formula again,

226
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:06,077
I'm going to estimate as sum

227
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:08,089
of 1 through m of x(i),

228
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:11,073
minus Mu squared,

229
00:08:12,012 --> 00:08:13,012
and so this Mu here is

230
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:14,002
actually the Mu that I compute

231
00:08:14,044 --> 00:08:15,057
over here using this formula,

232
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,092
and what the variance is, or

233
00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:18,088
one interpretation of the variance,

234
00:08:19,043 --> 00:08:20,023
is that, if you look at the

235
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:21,057
this term, that's the square

236
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:23,057
difference between the value

237
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:25,018
I've got in my example minus

238
00:08:25,074 --> 00:08:28,030
the mean, minus the center, minus the mean of distribution.

239
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:29,068
And so, you know, the

240
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:30,062
variance, I'm gonna estimate

241
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:32,052
as just the average of

242
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:35,051
the square differences, between my examples, minus the mean.

243
00:08:37,026 --> 00:08:38,037
And as a side comment,

244
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,014
only for those of you that are experts

245
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:41,082
in statistics, if you're

246
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,069
an expert in statistics and if

247
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,057
you've heard of maximum likelihood estimation,

248
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,095
then these estimates are actually the

249
00:08:48,076 --> 00:08:50,052
maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters

250
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:52,059
of Mu and sigma squared.

251
00:08:53,022 --> 00:08:55,025
But if you haven't heard of that before, don't worry about it.

252
00:08:55,044 --> 00:08:56,050
All you need to know is that

253
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:57,087
these are the two standard formulas

254
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,009
for how you try to

255
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:03,082
figure out what our Mu and sigma squared given the dataset.

256
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:06,013
Finally one last side comment.

257
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:07,080
Again only for those of

258
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:10,051
you that has maybe taken a statistics class before.

259
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:12,003
But if you have taken a statistics

260
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,052
class before, some of you

261
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:14,062
may have seen the formula here

262
00:09:14,082 --> 00:09:15,080
where, you know, this is m minus

263
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:17,029
1, instead of m. So

264
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,030
this first term becomes 1

265
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:20,040
over m minus 1, instead

266
00:09:20,045 --> 00:09:22,063
of 1 over m. In machine

267
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:25,016
learning, people tend to use this 1 over m formula.

268
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,023
But in practice, whether it

269
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:28,048
is 1 over m or 1

270
00:09:28,054 --> 00:09:29,071
over m minus one, makes essentially

271
00:09:30,016 --> 00:09:32,028
no difference, assuming, you know, m is

272
00:09:32,053 --> 00:09:34,066
reasonably large, it's a large training set size.

273
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,048
So, just in case you've seen

274
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:38,057
this other version before, in either

275
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,097
version it works just equally

276
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:41,062
well, but in machine

277
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,085
learning most people tend to

278
00:09:42,097 --> 00:09:44,040
use 1 over m in this formula.

279
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:46,074
And the two versions have slightly

280
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,076
different theoretical properties, slightly different

281
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:50,052
mathematical properties, but in

282
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:54,008
practice it really makes very little difference, if any.

283
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:57,066
So, hopefully, you now have

284
00:09:57,088 --> 00:09:58,089
a good sense of what the

285
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:00,040
Gaussian distribution looks like,

286
00:10:00,074 --> 00:10:02,021
as well as how to estimate

287
00:10:02,026 --> 00:10:03,073
the parameters, mu and sigma

288
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,076
squared, of the Gaussian distribution, and

289
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,050
if you're given a training set,

290
00:10:07,085 --> 00:10:08,094
that is if you're given a

291
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:10,022
set of data that you suspect

292
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:12,035
comes from a Gaussian

293
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,019
distribution with unknown parameters using sigma squared.

294
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,050
In the next video, we'll start

295
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,082
to take this and apply it

296
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:20,080
to develop the anomaly detection algorithm.
