1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,006
In this next set of

2
00:00:01,017 --> 00:00:01,097
videos, I would like to

3
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:03,070
tell you about recommender systems.

4
00:00:04,073 --> 00:00:05,080
There are two reasons, I had

5
00:00:05,094 --> 00:00:08,058
two motivations for why I wanted to talk about recommender systems.

6
00:00:09,064 --> 00:00:10,067
The first is just that it

7
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:13,083
is an important application of machine learning.

8
00:00:14,016 --> 00:00:15,067
Over the last few years, occasionally I

9
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,083
visit different, you know, technology

10
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,071
companies here in Silicon Valley

11
00:00:18,082 --> 00:00:20,003
and I often talk to people

12
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,026
working on machine learning applications there

13
00:00:21,037 --> 00:00:23,001
and so I've asked

14
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:24,012
people what are the most

15
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:26,083
important applications of machine

16
00:00:27,044 --> 00:00:28,053
learning or what are the machine

17
00:00:28,055 --> 00:00:29,051
learning applications that you would most like to get

18
00:00:29,078 --> 00:00:31,012
an improvement in the performance of.

19
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:32,068
And one of the most frequent

20
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:34,024
answers I heard was that

21
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:35,071
there are many groups out in Silicon

22
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,025
Valley now, trying to build better recommender systems.

23
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:40,046
So, if you think about

24
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,039
what the websites are

25
00:00:42,053 --> 00:00:44,010
like Amazon, or what Netflix

26
00:00:44,084 --> 00:00:46,010
or what eBay, or what

27
00:00:46,082 --> 00:00:48,022
iTunes Genius, made by Apple

28
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:49,045
does, there are many websites

29
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:51,052
or systems that try to

30
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:53,014
recommend new products to use.

31
00:00:53,035 --> 00:00:54,038
So, Amazon recommends new books

32
00:00:54,063 --> 00:00:55,084
to you, Netflix try to recommend

33
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:58,009
new movies to you, and so on.

34
00:00:58,042 --> 00:00:59,056
And these sorts of recommender systems,

35
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:01,047
that look at what books you

36
00:01:01,056 --> 00:01:02,042
may have purchased in the past,

37
00:01:02,089 --> 00:01:03,082
or what movies you have rated

38
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:05,009
in the past, but these are

39
00:01:05,014 --> 00:01:06,039
the systems that are responsible

40
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:09,040
for today, a substantial fraction of

41
00:01:09,062 --> 00:01:10,062
Amazon's revenue and for a

42
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,051
company like Netflix, the recommendations

43
00:01:13,095 --> 00:01:14,070
that they make to the users

44
00:01:15,018 --> 00:01:16,060
is also responsible for a

45
00:01:16,082 --> 00:01:18,025
substantial fraction of the movies

46
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:20,070
watched by their users. 
And so an

47
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:22,040
improvement in performance of

48
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:24,006
a recommender system can have

49
00:01:24,068 --> 00:01:26,034
a substantial and immediate

50
00:01:26,087 --> 00:01:28,001
impact on the bottom line of

51
00:01:28,037 --> 00:01:31,037
many of these

52
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,065
companies. Recommender systems is kind of a funny

53
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:34,053
problem, within academic machine

54
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:35,089
learning so that we could

55
00:01:35,098 --> 00:01:37,023
go to an academic machine learning conference,

56
00:01:38,043 --> 00:01:39,095
the problem of recommender systems,

57
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:41,056
actually receives relatively little attention,

58
00:01:42,043 --> 00:01:43,068
or at least it's sort of a smaller

59
00:01:43,095 --> 00:01:46,020
fraction of what goes on within Academia.

60
00:01:47,014 --> 00:01:48,001
But if you look at what's happening,

61
00:01:48,056 --> 00:01:50,020
many technology companies, the ability

62
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,050
to build these systems seems to be a high priority for many companies.

63
00:01:54,043 --> 00:01:56,045
And that's one of the reasons why I want to talk about them in this class.

64
00:01:58,028 --> 00:01:59,042
The second reason that I

65
00:01:59,051 --> 00:02:00,056
want to talk about recommender systems

66
00:02:01,017 --> 00:02:02,045
is that as we approach

67
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,007
the last few sets of videos

68
00:02:05,012 --> 00:02:06,029
of this class I wanted to talk about

69
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,073
a few of the big ideas

70
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,040
in machine learning and share with you,

71
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:11,056
you know, some of the big ideas in machine learning.

72
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,084
And we've already seen

73
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:15,087
in this class that features are

74
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:17,000
important for machine learning, the

75
00:02:17,063 --> 00:02:19,016
features you choose will have

76
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,034
a big effect on the performance of your learning algorithm.

77
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:24,031
So there's this big idea in machine

78
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:25,088
learning, which is that for

79
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:27,062
some problems, maybe not

80
00:02:27,078 --> 00:02:29,068
all problems, but some problems, there

81
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,061
are algorithms that can try

82
00:02:31,094 --> 00:02:34,086
to automatically learn a good set of features for you.

83
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:35,096
So rather than trying to hand

84
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:37,084
design, or hand code the

85
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:39,012
features, which is mostly what we've

86
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,034
been doing so far, there are a

87
00:02:40,043 --> 00:02:41,078
few settings where you might

88
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:42,065
be able to have an

89
00:02:42,077 --> 00:02:43,078
algorithm, just to learn what feature to

90
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:45,019
use, and the recommender

91
00:02:45,058 --> 00:02:47,068
systems is just one example of that sort of setting.

92
00:02:47,087 --> 00:02:49,025
There are many others, but engraved

93
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,015
through recommender systems, will be

94
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:52,077
able to go a little

95
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:54,037
bit into this idea of learning

96
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:56,044
the features and you'll be

97
00:02:56,053 --> 00:02:57,031
able to see at least one example

98
00:02:58,016 --> 00:03:00,012
of this, I think, big idea in machine learning as well.

99
00:03:01,021 --> 00:03:02,080
So, without further ado, let's

100
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,021
get started, and talk

101
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,012
about the recommender system problem formulation.

102
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:09,068
As my running example, I'm

103
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:11,021
going to use the

104
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:13,022
modern problem of predicting movie ratings.

105
00:03:14,015 --> 00:03:14,063
So, here's a problem.

106
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:16,052
Imagine that you're a

107
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:18,013
website or a company that

108
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,034
sells or rents out movies, or what have you.

109
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:22,087
And so, you know, Amazon, and Netflix, and

110
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:24,093
I think iTunes are all examples

111
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:28,018
of companies that do this,

112
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,044
and let's say you let

113
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:32,061
your users rate different movies,

114
00:03:33,056 --> 00:03:34,012
using a 1 to 5 star rating.

115
00:03:34,056 --> 00:03:36,030
So, users may, you know,

116
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,006
something one, two, three, four or five stars.

117
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,043
In order to make this example

118
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:43,016
just a little bit nicer, I'm

119
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:44,086
going to allow 0 to

120
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:46,071
5 stars as well,

121
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,016
because that just makes some of the math come out just nicer.

122
00:03:49,036 --> 00:03:51,058
Although most of these websites use the 1 to 5 star scale.

123
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,052
So here, I have 5 movies.

124
00:03:55,011 --> 00:03:56,059
You know, Love That

125
00:03:56,071 --> 00:03:58,005
Lasts, Romance Forever, Cute Puppies of

126
00:03:58,015 --> 00:04:00,022
Love, Nonstop Car Chases,

127
00:04:01,003 --> 00:04:03,034
and Swords vs. Karate.

128
00:04:03,055 --> 00:04:04,037
And we have 4 users, which,

129
00:04:05,002 --> 00:04:06,018
calling, you know, Alice, Bob, Carol,

130
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,061
and Dave, with initials A, B,

131
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:09,078
C, and D, we'll call them users 1, 2, 3, and 4.

132
00:04:10,038 --> 00:04:11,093
So, let's say Alice really

133
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,036
likes Love That Lasts and

134
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:15,068
rates that 5 stars, likes Romance

135
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,022
Forever, rates it 5 stars.

136
00:04:18,006 --> 00:04:19,005
She did not watch Cute Puppies

137
00:04:19,037 --> 00:04:20,081
of Love, and did rate it, so we

138
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,018
don't have a rating for that,

139
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,039
and Alice really did not

140
00:04:24,058 --> 00:04:27,017
like Nonstop Car Chases or

141
00:04:27,024 --> 00:04:29,032
Swords vs. Karate. And a different user

142
00:04:29,072 --> 00:04:31,038
Bob, user two, maybe rated

143
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,068
a different set of movies, maybe

144
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:33,057
she likes to Love at Last,

145
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,051
did not to watch Romance Forever,

146
00:04:36,012 --> 00:04:37,095
just have a rating of 4, a 0,

147
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:42,052
a 0, and maybe our 3rd user,

148
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:44,027
rates this 0, did not watch

149
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:45,061
that one, 0, 5, 5, and, you know, let's just

150
00:04:45,098 --> 00:04:48,014
fill in some of the numbers.

151
00:04:52,014 --> 00:04:53,091
And so just to introduce a

152
00:04:53,097 --> 00:04:55,008
bit of notation, this notation

153
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,019
that we'll be using throughout, I'm going

154
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:59,064
to use NU to denote the number of users.

155
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:02,080
So in this example, NU will be equal to 4.

156
00:05:03,055 --> 00:05:04,075
So the u-subscript stands for

157
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,029
users and Nm,

158
00:05:07,076 --> 00:05:08,089
going to use to denote the number

159
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,020
of movies, so here I have five movies

160
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,095
so Nm equals equals 5.

161
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:15,031
And you know for this example, I have

162
00:05:15,094 --> 00:05:17,063
for this example, I have loosely

163
00:05:18,092 --> 00:05:20,043
3 maybe romantic or

164
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:24,001
romantic comedy movies and 2

165
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:25,075
action movies and you know, if

166
00:05:25,095 --> 00:05:27,045
you look at this small example, it

167
00:05:27,057 --> 00:05:29,043
looks like Alice and Bob are

168
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:31,036
giving high ratings to these

169
00:05:32,017 --> 00:05:33,064
romantic comedies or movies

170
00:05:33,095 --> 00:05:34,085
about love, and giving very

171
00:05:35,013 --> 00:05:36,079
low ratings about the action

172
00:05:37,006 --> 00:05:39,047
movies, and for Carol and Dave, it's the opposite, right?

173
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:40,080
Carol and Dave, users three

174
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,017
and four, really like the

175
00:05:42,035 --> 00:05:43,038
action movies and give them

176
00:05:43,049 --> 00:05:45,001
high ratings, but don't like

177
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,091
the romance and love-

178
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:48,043
type movies as much.

179
00:05:50,032 --> 00:05:51,072
Specifically, in the recommender system

180
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:54,017
problem, we are given the following data.

181
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:56,023
Our data comprises the following:

182
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:58,077
we have these values r(i, j), and

183
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,007
r(i, j) is 1 if user

184
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:01,057
J has rated movie I.

185
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,092
So our users rate only

186
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:04,019
some of the movies, and so,

187
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:06,005
you know, we don't have

188
00:06:06,018 --> 00:06:08,013
ratings for those movies.

189
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:09,088
And whenever r(i, j) is equal

190
00:06:10,044 --> 00:06:11,079
to 1, whenever user j has

191
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:13,014
rated movie i, we also

192
00:06:13,066 --> 00:06:15,031
get this number y(i, j),

193
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,051
which is the rating given by

194
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:18,087
user j to movie i. And

195
00:06:19,002 --> 00:06:20,037
so, y(i, j) would be

196
00:06:20,054 --> 00:06:22,088
a number from zero to

197
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,036
five, depending on the star

198
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,081
rating, zero to five

199
00:06:26,016 --> 00:06:28,047
stars that user gave that particular movie.

200
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:31,069
So, the recommender system problem

201
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:33,054
is given this data

202
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:35,020
that has give these r(i, j)'s

203
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:38,054
and the y(i, j)'s to look

204
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:40,014
through the data and

205
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:41,069
look at all the movie ratings that

206
00:06:41,086 --> 00:06:42,093
are missing and to try

207
00:06:43,022 --> 00:06:44,058
to predict what these values

208
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:47,029
of the question marks should be.

209
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:48,070
In the particular example, I have

210
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,092
a very small number of movies

211
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,025
and a very small number of users

212
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:52,079
and so most users have rated most

213
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:53,081
movies but in the realistic

214
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:55,087
settings your users each

215
00:06:56,004 --> 00:06:57,012
of your users may have rated

216
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,093
only a minuscule fraction of your

217
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,017
movies but looking at this

218
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:01,043
data, you know, if Alice and Bob

219
00:07:01,073 --> 00:07:02,099
both like the romantic movies

220
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:05,081
maybe we think that Alice would have given this a five.

221
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:07,029
Maybe we think Bob would have

222
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:08,056
given this a 4.5

223
00:07:08,075 --> 00:07:10,056
or some high value, as we

224
00:07:10,068 --> 00:07:11,070
think maybe Carol and Dave

225
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:15,005
were doing these very low ratings.

226
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:16,051
And Dave, well, if Dave really likes action movies,

227
00:07:16,074 --> 00:07:17,079
maybe he would have given

228
00:07:18,049 --> 00:07:19,054
Swords and Karate a 4

229
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:22,007
rating or maybe a 5 rating, okay?

230
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:23,069
And so, our job in developing

231
00:07:24,032 --> 00:07:25,094
a recommender system is to

232
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,012
come up with a learning

233
00:07:28,036 --> 00:07:29,043
algorithm that can automatically

234
00:07:30,037 --> 00:07:31,049
go fill in these missing values

235
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:33,025
for us so that we

236
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:34,037
can look at, say, the

237
00:07:34,049 --> 00:07:35,062
movies that the user has

238
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,037
not yet watched, and recommend

239
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:39,056
new movies to that user to watch.

240
00:07:39,086 --> 00:07:42,050
You try to predict what else might be interesting to a user.

241
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,088
So that's the formalism of the recommender system problem.

242
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:50,044
In the next video we'll start

243
00:07:50,076 --> 00:07:53,036
to develop a learning algorithm to address this problem.
