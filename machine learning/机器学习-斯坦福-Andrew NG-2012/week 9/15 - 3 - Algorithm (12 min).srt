1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:01,024
In the last video, we talked

2
00:00:01,056 --> 00:00:03,066
about the Gaussian distribution. In

3
00:00:03,081 --> 00:00:05,034
this video lets apply that

4
00:00:05,044 --> 00:00:07,029
to develop an anomaly detection algorithm.

5
00:00:10,035 --> 00:00:11,068
Let's say that we have an

6
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:13,039
unlabeled training set of M

7
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:15,041
examples, and each of

8
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:16,073
these examples is going to

9
00:00:16,076 --> 00:00:18,035
be a feature in Rn so

10
00:00:18,044 --> 00:00:19,042
your training set could be,

11
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,085
feature vectors from the last

12
00:00:22,073 --> 00:00:24,014
M aircraft engines being manufactured.

13
00:00:24,096 --> 00:00:26,073
Or it could be features from m

14
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:28,028
users or something else.

15
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:30,046
The way we are going to address

16
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:32,031
anomaly detection, is we are

17
00:00:32,035 --> 00:00:33,047
going to model p of x

18
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:35,064
from the data sets.

19
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:38,053
We're going to try to figure out what are high probability features, what

20
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:40,061
are lower probability types of features.

21
00:00:41,035 --> 00:00:42,081
So, x is a

22
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,089
vector and what we

23
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:46,057
are going to do is model p of

24
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:48,086
x, as probability of x1,

25
00:00:49,043 --> 00:00:50,039
that is of the first component

26
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:53,017
of x, times the probability

27
00:00:53,099 --> 00:00:54,096
of x2, that is the probability

28
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,035
of the second feature, times the

29
00:00:57,045 --> 00:00:58,085
probability of the third

30
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:01,022
feature, and so on up

31
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,028
to the probability of the final feature

32
00:01:03,075 --> 00:01:03,092
of Xn.

33
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,031
Now I'm leaving space here cause I'll fill in something in a minute.

34
00:01:08,078 --> 00:01:09,071
So, how do we

35
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:10,095
model each of these terms,

36
00:01:11,045 --> 00:01:13,001
p of X1, p of X2, and so on.

37
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,037
What we're going to do,

38
00:01:15,068 --> 00:01:16,085
is assume that the feature,

39
00:01:17,048 --> 00:01:19,082
X1, is distributed according

40
00:01:20,034 --> 00:01:22,095
to a Gaussian distribution, with

41
00:01:23,015 --> 00:01:25,014
some mean, which you

42
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:25,084
want to write as mu1 and

43
00:01:25,092 --> 00:01:26,090
some variance, which I'm going

44
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:28,056
to write as sigma squared 1,

45
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,068
and so p of X1 is

46
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:32,001
going to be a Gaussian

47
00:01:32,034 --> 00:01:34,040
probability distribution, with mean

48
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,057
mu1 and variance sigma squared 1.

49
00:01:38,023 --> 00:01:39,065
And similarly I'm

50
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:40,056
going to assume that X2

51
00:01:40,076 --> 00:01:42,021
is distributed, Gaussian,

52
00:01:42,087 --> 00:01:44,062
that's what this little tilda stands for,

53
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,021
that means distributed Gaussian

54
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:49,048
with mean mu2 and Sigma

55
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:51,078
squared 2, so it's distributed according

56
00:01:52,017 --> 00:01:54,023
to a different Gaussian, which has

57
00:01:54,045 --> 00:01:58,001
a different set of parameters, mu2 sigma square 2.

58
00:01:58,012 --> 00:02:00,015
And similarly, you know,

59
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:04,001
X3 is yet another

60
00:02:04,048 --> 00:02:06,059
Gaussian, so this

61
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:09,009
can have a different mean and

62
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,062
a different standard deviation than the

63
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:15,037
other features, and so on, up to XN.

64
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,074
And so that's my model.

65
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,022
Just as a side comment for

66
00:02:20,037 --> 00:02:21,049
those of you that are experts in

67
00:02:21,088 --> 00:02:22,077
statistics, it turns out that

68
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:23,084
this equation that I just

69
00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:25,059
wrote out actually corresponds to an

70
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:27,049
independence assumption on the

71
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:29,055
values of the features x1 through xn.

72
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:31,052
But in practice it turns out

73
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:34,000
that the algorithm of this fragment, it works just fine,

74
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,033
whether or not these features are

75
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:37,078
anywhere close to independent and

76
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:39,081
even if independence assumption doesn't

77
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:41,083
hold true this algorithm works just fine.

78
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:45,087
But in case you don't know

79
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:47,037
those terms I just used independence assumptions and so on,

80
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,046
don't worry about it.

81
00:02:49,016 --> 00:02:50,084
You'll be able to understand

82
00:02:51,036 --> 00:02:52,068
it and implement this algorithm just fine

83
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:55,031
and that comment was really meant only for the experts in statistics.

84
00:02:57,078 --> 00:02:58,087
Finally, in order to

85
00:02:59,021 --> 00:03:00,031
wrap this up, let me

86
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:04,068
take this expression and write it a little bit more compactly.

87
00:03:05,012 --> 00:03:06,019
So, we're going to

88
00:03:06,031 --> 00:03:07,050
write this is a product

89
00:03:07,074 --> 00:03:09,052
from J equals one

90
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:11,084
through N, of P

91
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:15,034
of XJ parameterized by

92
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:17,093
mu j comma sigma squared

93
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,050
j. So this funny

94
00:03:21,078 --> 00:03:23,033
symbol here, there is

95
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,021
capital Greek alphabet pi,

96
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:27,059
that funny symbol there corresponds to

97
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:29,097
taking the product of a set of values.

98
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:32,028
And so, you're familiar with

99
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,093
the summation notation, so the

100
00:03:34,052 --> 00:03:36,046
sum from i equals one through

101
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:39,006
n, of i. This

102
00:03:39,096 --> 00:03:41,081
means 1 + 2 + 3 plus

103
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:43,072
dot dot dot, up to

104
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,034
n. Where as this

105
00:03:45,065 --> 00:03:46,090
funny symbol here, this product

106
00:03:47,038 --> 00:03:48,062
symbol, right product from i

107
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:50,031
equals 1 through n

108
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:52,021
of i.  Then this

109
00:03:52,052 --> 00:03:54,053
means that, it's just like summation except that we're now multiplying.

110
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,068
This becomes 1 times

111
00:03:56,087 --> 00:03:58,069
2 times 3 times up

112
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,033
to N. And so using

113
00:04:01,086 --> 00:04:03,043
this product notation, this

114
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:05,087
product from j equals 1 through n of this expression.

115
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:08,043
It's just more compact, it's

116
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,096
just shorter way for writing

117
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:12,081
out this product of

118
00:04:13,012 --> 00:04:14,040
of all of these terms up there.

119
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:16,019
Since we're are taking these p

120
00:04:16,043 --> 00:04:17,050
of x j given mu j

121
00:04:17,073 --> 00:04:18,074
comma sigma squared j terms

122
00:04:19,012 --> 00:04:20,029
and multiplying them together.

123
00:04:21,054 --> 00:04:22,082
And, by the way the problem

124
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:25,037
of estimating this distribution

125
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,012
p of x, they're sometimes called

126
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:29,054
the problem of density estimation.

127
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:31,026
Hence the title of the slide.

128
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,031
So putting everything together, here

129
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,092
is our anomaly detection algorithm.

130
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:40,029
The first step is to choose

131
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:41,060
features, or come up with

132
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:42,074
features xi that we think

133
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:45,033
might be indicative of anomalous examples.

134
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:47,001
So what I mean by that,

135
00:04:47,024 --> 00:04:48,049
is, try to come

136
00:04:48,068 --> 00:04:49,099
up with features, so that when there's

137
00:04:50,027 --> 00:04:51,062
an unusual user in your

138
00:04:52,018 --> 00:04:53,000
system that may be doing

139
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:54,079
fraudulent things, or when the

140
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:56,067
aircraft engine examples, you know

141
00:04:56,075 --> 00:04:59,050
there's something funny, something strange about one of the aircraft engines.

142
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:01,023
Choose features X I, that

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,032
you think might take on unusually

144
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,086
large values, or unusually

145
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:08,075
small values, for what an

146
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:10,016
anomalous example might look like.

147
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:12,043
But more generally, just try

148
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:14,033
to choose features that describe general

149
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:19,037
properties of the things that you're collecting data on.

150
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:21,036
Next, given a training set,

151
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:23,098
of M, unlabled examples,

152
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,098
X1 through X M, we

153
00:05:27,017 --> 00:05:28,057
then fit the parameters,

154
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:30,017
mu 1 through mu n, and

155
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,048
sigma squared 1 through sigma

156
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:33,045
squared n, and so these

157
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,081
were the formulas similar to

158
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,042
the formulas we have

159
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:37,061
in the previous video, that we're

160
00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:39,018
going to use the estimate

161
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:41,012
each of these parameters, and just to give

162
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:43,067
some interpretation, mu J,

163
00:05:44,006 --> 00:05:47,082
that's my average value of the j feature.

164
00:05:48,072 --> 00:05:51,057
Mu j goes in this term p of xj.

165
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:53,087
which is parametrized by mu J

166
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:55,058
and sigma squared J. And

167
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:57,088
so this says for the

168
00:05:58,036 --> 00:05:59,062
mu J just take the

169
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:00,072
mean over my training

170
00:06:01,006 --> 00:06:02,093
set of the values of the j feature.

171
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:05,010
And, just to mention, that you

172
00:06:05,022 --> 00:06:07,041
do this, you compute these

173
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:08,082
formulas for j equals

174
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:10,036
one through n. So use

175
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,095
these formulas to estimate mu

176
00:06:12,023 --> 00:06:14,001
1, to estimate mu

177
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,062
2, and so on up to

178
00:06:16,017 --> 00:06:17,045
mu n, and similarly for sigma

179
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:19,006
squared, and it's also

180
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:21,052
possible to come up with vectorized versions of these.

181
00:06:21,082 --> 00:06:22,089
So if you think of

182
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,022
mu as a vector, so mu

183
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:27,043
if is a vector there's mu 1,

184
00:06:27,075 --> 00:06:29,023
mu 2, down to mu

185
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,018
n, then a vectorized

186
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:33,050
version of that set

187
00:06:33,091 --> 00:06:35,052
of parameters can be written

188
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:37,082
like so sum from 1

189
00:06:37,087 --> 00:06:39,061
equals one through n xi.

190
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:41,029
So, this formula that I

191
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:43,052
just wrote out estimates this

192
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:45,016
xi as the feature vectors

193
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:48,013
that estimates mu for all the values of n simultaneously.

194
00:06:49,013 --> 00:06:50,006
And it's also possible to come

195
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,012
up with a vectorized formula for

196
00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:55,011
estimating sigma squared j. Finally,

197
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,088
when you're given a new example, so

198
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,026
when you have a new aircraft engine

199
00:06:59,074 --> 00:07:01,042
and you want to know is this aircraft engine anomalous.

200
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,043
What we need to do is then

201
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,061
compute p of x, what's the probability of this new example?

202
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,067
So, p of x is equal

203
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:09,099
to this product, and

204
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,013
what you implement, what you compute,

205
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:14,004
is this formula and

206
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,061
where over here, this thing

207
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:17,089
here this is just the

208
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:19,025
formula for the Gaussian

209
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,000
probability, so you compute

210
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,087
this thing, and finally if

211
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:24,042
this probability is very small,

212
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:26,037
then you flag this thing as an anomaly.

213
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:29,037
Here's an example of an application of this method.

214
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:31,086
Let's say we have this data

215
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,043
set plotted on the upper left of this slide.

216
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:38,086
if you look at this, well, lets look the feature of x1.

217
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:40,063
If you look at this data set, it

218
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:42,060
looks like on average, the features

219
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,032
x1 has a mean of about 5

220
00:07:45,054 --> 00:07:47,042
and the standard deviation, if

221
00:07:47,058 --> 00:07:48,066
you only look at just the x1

222
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,002
values of this data set

223
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:51,072
has the standard deviation of maybe 2.

224
00:07:52,037 --> 00:07:55,011
So that sigma 1 and

225
00:07:55,045 --> 00:07:57,037
looks like x2 the

226
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:59,006
values of the features as

227
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:00,037
measured on the vertical axis,

228
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,073
looks like it has an average

229
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,011
value of about 3, and

230
00:08:03,037 --> 00:08:05,075
a standard deviation of about 1. So if

231
00:08:05,087 --> 00:08:06,093
you take this data set and if

232
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,068
you estimate mu1, mu2, sigma1,

233
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:11,041
sigma2, this is what you get.

234
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:12,093
And again, I'm writing sigma here,

235
00:08:13,013 --> 00:08:14,062
I'm think about standard deviations, but

236
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,024
the formula on the previous 5

237
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:17,063
actually gave the estimates of the squares

238
00:08:18,012 --> 00:08:20,067
of theses things, so sigma squared 1 and sigma squared 2.

239
00:08:20,093 --> 00:08:21,092
So, just be careful whether

240
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:23,025
you are using sigma 1, sigma

241
00:08:23,037 --> 00:08:25,049
2, or sigma squared 1 or sigma squared 2.

242
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:26,069
So, sigma squared 1 of course

243
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:28,050
would be equal to 4, for

244
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:32,025
example, as the square of 2.

245
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,000
And in pictures what p of

246
00:08:34,017 --> 00:08:35,054
x1 parametrized by mu1 and

247
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:36,083
sigma squared 1 and p

248
00:08:37,012 --> 00:08:38,012
of x2, parametrized by mu

249
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:39,004
2 and sigma squared 2, that

250
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,036
would look like these two distributions over here.

251
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:44,027
And, turns out that

252
00:08:44,048 --> 00:08:45,096
if were to plot of p

253
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:47,053
of x, right, which

254
00:08:47,071 --> 00:08:49,000
is the product of these two

255
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:50,045
things, you can actually get

256
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:52,076
a surface plot that looks like this.

257
00:08:53,036 --> 00:08:54,037
This is a plot of p

258
00:08:54,063 --> 00:08:55,091
of x, where the height

259
00:08:56,038 --> 00:08:57,073
above of this, where the

260
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,095
height of this surface at

261
00:08:58,099 --> 00:09:01,036
a particular point, so given a

262
00:09:01,047 --> 00:09:03,066
particular x1 x2

263
00:09:03,092 --> 00:09:05,063
values of x2 if

264
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:07,083
x1 equals 2, x equal 2, that's this point.

265
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,045
And the height of this 3-D

266
00:09:09,071 --> 00:09:11,027
surface here, that's p

267
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:14,041
of x. So p of x, that is the height

268
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:16,022
of this plot, is

269
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:17,051
literally just p of x1

270
00:09:18,063 --> 00:09:20,000
parametrized by mu 1 sigma

271
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:22,053
squared 1, times p

272
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,004
of x2 parametrized by

273
00:09:25,012 --> 00:09:27,052
mu 2 sigma squared 2.

274
00:09:27,072 --> 00:09:29,017
Now, so this is

275
00:09:29,032 --> 00:09:31,039
how we fit the parameters to this data.

276
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,095
Let's see if we have a couple of new examples.

277
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:35,009
Maybe I have a new example there.

278
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,034
Is this an anomaly or not?

279
00:09:38,054 --> 00:09:39,022
Or, maybe I have a different

280
00:09:39,057 --> 00:09:41,086
example, maybe I have a different second example over there.

281
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:43,039
So, is that an anomaly or not?

282
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:47,004
They way we do that is, we

283
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,047
would set some value for

284
00:09:48,062 --> 00:09:49,049
Epsilon, let's say I've chosen

285
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:51,022
Epsilon equals 0.02.

286
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:54,011
I'll say later how we choose Epsilon.

287
00:09:55,017 --> 00:09:56,011
But let's take this first

288
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,036
example, let me call this

289
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,050
example X1 test.

290
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,000
And let me call the second example

291
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,089
X2 test.

292
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:05,066
What we do is, we

293
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:07,037
then compute p of

294
00:10:07,053 --> 00:10:08,074
X1 test, so we use

295
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:10,039
this formula to compute it and

296
00:10:11,013 --> 00:10:12,075
this looks like a pretty large value.

297
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:15,055
In particular, this is greater

298
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:18,048
than, or greater than or equal to epsilon.

299
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:19,066
And so this is a pretty

300
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,028
high probability at least bigger

301
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:22,050
than epsilon, so we'll say that

302
00:10:22,097 --> 00:10:24,049
X1 test is not an anomaly.

303
00:10:25,064 --> 00:10:27,037
Whereas, if you compute p of

304
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:29,080
X2 test, well that is just a much smaller value.

305
00:10:30,016 --> 00:10:31,034
So this is less than

306
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:32,049
epsilon and so we'll say

307
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:34,039
that that is indeed an anomaly,

308
00:10:34,086 --> 00:10:37,035
because it is much smaller than that epsilon that we then chose.

309
00:10:38,045 --> 00:10:39,095
And in fact, I'd improve it here.

310
00:10:40,046 --> 00:10:43,034
What this is really saying is that, you look through the 3d surface plot.

311
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:46,026
It's saying that all the

312
00:10:46,035 --> 00:10:47,094
values of x1 and x2

313
00:10:48,021 --> 00:10:50,057
that have a high height

314
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,076
above the surface, corresponds to

315
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:55,015
an a non-anomalous example of an OK or normal example.

316
00:10:55,097 --> 00:10:57,045
Whereas all the points far out

317
00:10:57,063 --> 00:10:58,094
here, all the points out

318
00:10:59,014 --> 00:11:00,046
here, all of those

319
00:11:00,058 --> 00:11:01,074
points have very low

320
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,094
probability, so we are

321
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:04,030
going to flag those points

322
00:11:04,062 --> 00:11:06,035
as anomalous, and so it's gonna define

323
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:07,078
some region, that maybe looks

324
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,048
like this, so that everything

325
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,015
outside this, it flags

326
00:11:12,037 --> 00:11:12,058
as anomalous,

327
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:16,025
whereas the things inside this

328
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:18,034
ellipse I just drew, if it

329
00:11:18,057 --> 00:11:21,032
considers okay, or non-anomalous, not anomalous examples.

330
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:24,003
And so this example x2

331
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:26,025
test lies outside

332
00:11:26,064 --> 00:11:27,050
that region, and so it

333
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:30,027
has very small probability, and so we consider it an anomalous example.

334
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,099
In this video we talked about how to

335
00:11:33,046 --> 00:11:35,044
estimate p of x, the probability of

336
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:36,084
x, for the purpose of

337
00:11:36,092 --> 00:11:38,074
developing an anomaly detection algorithm.

338
00:11:39,087 --> 00:11:40,088
And in this video, we also

339
00:11:41,025 --> 00:11:42,097
stepped through an entire process

340
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,009
of giving data set, we

341
00:11:45,034 --> 00:11:47,074
have, fitting the parameters, doing parameter estimations.

342
00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:50,057
We get mu and sigma parameters, and

343
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,017
then taking new examples and deciding

344
00:11:52,074 --> 00:11:54,011
if the new examples are anomalous or not.

345
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,079
In the next few videos we

346
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:58,058
will delve deeper into this algorithm,

347
00:11:58,098 --> 00:11:59,092
and talk a bit more

348
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:02,030
about how to actually get this to work well.
