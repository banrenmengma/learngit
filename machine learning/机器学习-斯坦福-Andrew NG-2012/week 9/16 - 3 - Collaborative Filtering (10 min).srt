1
00:00:01,006 --> 00:00:02,041
In this video we'll talk about

2
00:00:02,062 --> 00:00:03,089
an approach to building a

3
00:00:03,097 --> 00:00:06,038
recommender system that's called collaborative filtering.

4
00:00:07,054 --> 00:00:08,088
The algorithm that we're talking

5
00:00:09,017 --> 00:00:10,040
about has a very interesting

6
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:11,083
property that it does

7
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:13,028
what is called feature learning and

8
00:00:13,078 --> 00:00:14,080
by that I mean that this

9
00:00:14,096 --> 00:00:16,026
will be an algorithm that can

10
00:00:16,044 --> 00:00:19,001
start to learn for itself what features to use.

11
00:00:21,012 --> 00:00:22,010
Here was the data set that

12
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,044
we had and we had

13
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:25,003
assumed that for each movie,

14
00:00:25,069 --> 00:00:27,000
someone had come and told

15
00:00:27,032 --> 00:00:28,064
us how romantic that

16
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:30,055
movie was and how much action there was in that movie.

17
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:32,088
But as you can imagine it

18
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:34,032
can be very difficult and time

19
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,039
consuming and expensive to actually try

20
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:37,085
to get someone to, you know,

21
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:39,043
watch each movie and tell

22
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,088
you how romantic each movie and

23
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,057
how action packed is each

24
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:44,027
movie, and often you'll

25
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:46,075
want even more features than just these two.

26
00:00:46,097 --> 00:00:48,013
So where do you get these features from?

27
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:50,092
So let's change the problem

28
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,021
a bit and suppose that

29
00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:55,015
we have a data set where

30
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,097
we do not know the values of these features.

31
00:00:58,038 --> 00:00:59,028
So we're given the data set

32
00:00:59,064 --> 00:01:01,014
of movies and of

33
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,054
how the users rated them, but we

34
00:01:03,075 --> 00:01:05,018
have no idea how romantic each

35
00:01:05,037 --> 00:01:06,014
movie is and we have no

36
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:07,065
idea how action packed each

37
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:09,093
movie is so I've replaced all of these things with question marks.

38
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:12,032
But now let's make a slightly different assumption.

39
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:15,056
Let's say we've gone to each of our users, and each of our users has told has told us

40
00:01:15,098 --> 00:01:18,051
how much they like the

41
00:01:18,081 --> 00:01:20,004
romantic movies and how much

42
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:22,031
they like action packed movies.

43
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,009
So Alice has associated a current of theta 1.

44
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:27,046
Bob theta 2.

45
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,043
Carol theta 3.

46
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:30,032
Dave theta 4.

47
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,053
And let's say we also use this

48
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:33,004
and that Alice tells us

49
00:01:33,037 --> 00:01:35,034
that she really

50
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,095
likes romantic movies and so

51
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,078
there's a five there which

52
00:01:39,028 --> 00:01:41,020
is the multiplier associated with X1 and lets

53
00:01:41,056 --> 00:01:42,068
say that Alice tells us she

54
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:45,003
really doesn't like action movies and so there's a 0 there.

55
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:47,018
And Bob tells us something similar

56
00:01:48,065 --> 00:01:49,076
so we have theta 2 over here.

57
00:01:50,062 --> 00:01:52,045
Whereas Carol tells us that

58
00:01:53,056 --> 00:01:54,071
she really likes action movies

59
00:01:55,023 --> 00:01:56,045
which is why there's a 5 there,

60
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,059
that's the multiplier associated with X2,

61
00:01:58,098 --> 00:02:00,015
and remember there's also

62
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,048
X0 equals 1 and let's

63
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:05,039
say that Carol tells us

64
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,000
she doesn't like romantic

65
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:09,063
movies and so on, similarly for Dave.

66
00:02:09,084 --> 00:02:11,003
So let's assume that somehow

67
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:12,083
we can go to users and

68
00:02:13,028 --> 00:02:14,059
each user J just tells

69
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,015
us what is the value

70
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:18,087
of theta J for them.

71
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:22,018
And so basically specifies to us of how much they like different types of movies.

72
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:25,028
If we can get these parameters

73
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:27,088
theta from our users then it

74
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:29,081
turns out that it becomes possible to

75
00:02:29,096 --> 00:02:31,021
try to infer what are the

76
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:33,071
values of x1 and x2 for each movie.

77
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,013
Let's look at an example.

78
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,056
Let's look at movie 1.

79
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:39,078
So that movie 1 has associated

80
00:02:40,058 --> 00:02:42,005
with it a feature vector x1.

81
00:02:42,088 --> 00:02:45,041
And you know this movie is called Love at last but let's ignore that.

82
00:02:45,077 --> 00:02:46,075
Let's pretend we don't know what

83
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:49,006
this movie is about, so let's ignore the title of this movie.

84
00:02:50,018 --> 00:02:52,027
All we know is that Alice loved this move.

85
00:02:52,044 --> 00:02:53,011
Bob loved this movie.

86
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:55,037
Carol and Dave hated this movie.

87
00:02:56,044 --> 00:02:57,044
So what can we infer?

88
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,090
Well, we know from the

89
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:00,050
feature vectors that Alice

90
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:03,018
and Bob love romantic movies

91
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:05,065
because they told us that there's a 5 here.

92
00:03:06,028 --> 00:03:07,047
Whereas Carol and Dave,

93
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:10,015
we know that they hate

94
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,091
romantic movies and that

95
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,099
they love action movies. So

96
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:16,005
because those are the parameter

97
00:03:16,034 --> 00:03:18,083
vectors that you know, uses 3 and 4, Carol and Dave, gave us.

98
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:20,094
And so based on the fact

99
00:03:21,038 --> 00:03:22,034
that movie 1 is loved

100
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:24,012
by Alice and Bob and

101
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:26,046
hated by Carol and Dave, we might

102
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,081
reasonably conclude that this is probably a romantic movie,

103
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:34,024
it is probably not much of an action movie.

104
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:36,036
this example is a little

105
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:38,009
bit mathematically simplified but what

106
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:40,033
we're really asking is what

107
00:03:40,059 --> 00:03:42,000
feature vector should X1 be

108
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:45,037
so that theta 1 transpose

109
00:03:46,003 --> 00:03:48,093
x1 is approximately equal to 5,

110
00:03:49,065 --> 00:03:51,069
that's Alice's rating, and

111
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:55,036
theta 2 transpose x1 is

112
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,065
also approximately equal to 5,

113
00:03:57,066 --> 00:03:59,009
and theta 3 transpose x1 is

114
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:02,018
approximately equal to 0,

115
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:05,025
so this would be Carol's rating, and

116
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:09,078
theta 4 transpose X1

117
00:04:10,074 --> 00:04:11,062
is approximately equal to 0.

118
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:13,052
And from this it looks

119
00:04:13,077 --> 00:04:16,000
like, you know, X1 equals

120
00:04:16,087 --> 00:04:18,076
one that's the intercept term, and

121
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:20,095
then 1.0, 0.0, that makes sense

122
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:22,038
given what we know of Alice,

123
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,011
Bob, Carol, and Dave's preferences

124
00:04:24,076 --> 00:04:25,093
for movies and the way they rated this movie.

125
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:29,007
And so more generally, we can

126
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:30,020
go down this list and try

127
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:31,051
to figure out what might

128
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:35,025
be reasonable features for these other movies as well.

129
00:04:39,016 --> 00:04:41,088
Let's formalize this problem of learning the features XI.

130
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,022
Let's say that our

131
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,086
users have given us their preferences.

132
00:04:46,057 --> 00:04:47,094
So let's say that our users have

133
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:49,010
come and, you know, told us

134
00:04:49,032 --> 00:04:50,080
these values for theta 1

135
00:04:50,088 --> 00:04:52,099
through theta of NU

136
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:54,043
and we want to learn the

137
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,012
feature vector XI for movie

138
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:58,001
number I. What we can

139
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:00,082
do is therefore pose the following optimization problem.

140
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:02,020
So we want to sum over

141
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,060
all the indices J for

142
00:05:04,093 --> 00:05:06,027
which we have a rating

143
00:05:06,094 --> 00:05:08,033
for movie I because

144
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:10,004
we're trying to learn the features

145
00:05:10,094 --> 00:05:13,056
for movie I that is this feature vector XI.

146
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,066
So and then what we

147
00:05:15,077 --> 00:05:18,044
want to do is minimize this squared

148
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:20,016
error, so we want to choose

149
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:22,043
features XI, so that,

150
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:25,000
you know, the predictive value of

151
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:26,081
how user J rates movie

152
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:28,017
I will be similar,

153
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:30,012
will be not too far in the

154
00:05:30,043 --> 00:05:31,091
squared error sense of the actual

155
00:05:32,052 --> 00:05:35,032
value YIJ that we actually observe in

156
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:37,012
the rating of user j

157
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:40,079
on movie I.
So, just to

158
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:42,031
summarize what this term does

159
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,006
is it tries to choose features

160
00:05:45,004 --> 00:05:46,058
XI so that for

161
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,020
all the users J that

162
00:05:48,036 --> 00:05:50,018
have rated that movie, the

163
00:05:50,086 --> 00:05:52,082
algorithm also predicts a

164
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:55,049
value for how that user would have rated that movie

165
00:05:56,017 --> 00:05:57,072
that is not too far, in

166
00:05:57,081 --> 00:05:59,073
the squared error sense, from the

167
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,031
actual value that the user had rated that movie.

168
00:06:03,037 --> 00:06:04,056
So that's the squared error term.

169
00:06:05,042 --> 00:06:07,019
As usual, we can

170
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:08,043
also add this sort of

171
00:06:08,051 --> 00:06:09,085
regularization term to prevent

172
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,087
the features from becoming too big.

173
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,061
So this is how we

174
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,091
would learn the features

175
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:19,013
for one specific movie but

176
00:06:19,068 --> 00:06:20,048
what we want to do is

177
00:06:20,074 --> 00:06:22,006
learn all the features for all

178
00:06:22,023 --> 00:06:23,081
the movies and so what

179
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:25,005
I'm going to do is add this

180
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:26,062
extra summation here so

181
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:28,083
I'm going to sum over all Nm

182
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:33,013
movies, N subscript m movies, and minimize

183
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:34,067
this objective on top

184
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,007
that sums of all movies.

185
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,093
And if you do that, you end up with the following optimization problem.

186
00:06:40,094 --> 00:06:42,031
And if you minimize

187
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:44,051
this, you have hopefully a

188
00:06:44,068 --> 00:06:47,043
reasonable set of features for all of your movies.

189
00:06:48,064 --> 00:06:50,007
So putting everything together, what

190
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,005
we, the algorithm we talked

191
00:06:51,032 --> 00:06:52,073
about in the previous video and

192
00:06:53,018 --> 00:06:54,081
the algorithm that we just talked about in this video.

193
00:06:55,073 --> 00:06:57,006
In the previous video, what we

194
00:06:57,018 --> 00:06:58,070
showed was that you know,

195
00:06:58,081 --> 00:06:59,069
if you have a set of

196
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,063
movie ratings, so if you

197
00:07:00,063 --> 00:07:03,095
have the data the rij's and

198
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:06,010
then you have the yij's that will be the movie ratings.

199
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,064
Then given features for your

200
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,080
different movies we can learn these parameters theta.

201
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:13,011
So if you knew the features,

202
00:07:13,082 --> 00:07:15,000
you can learn the parameters

203
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:16,085
theta for your different users.

204
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:19,076
And what we showed earlier in

205
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:21,039
this video is that if

206
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,086
your users are willing to

207
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,044
give you parameters, then you

208
00:07:25,056 --> 00:07:28,006
can estimate features for the different movies.

209
00:07:29,026 --> 00:07:31,049
So this is kind of a chicken and egg problem.

210
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,029
Which comes first?

211
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:35,056
You know, do we want if we can get the thetas, we can know the Xs.

212
00:07:36,006 --> 00:07:38,016
If we have the Xs, we can learn the thetas.

213
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,050
And what you can

214
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:41,079
do is, and then

215
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:43,000
this actually works, what you

216
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:44,052
can do is in fact randomly

217
00:07:45,017 --> 00:07:47,016
guess some value of the thetas.

218
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,019
Now based on your initial random

219
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,062
guess for the thetas, you can

220
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:52,052
then go ahead and use

221
00:07:53,016 --> 00:07:54,020
the procedure that we just talked

222
00:07:54,045 --> 00:07:55,081
about in order to

223
00:07:56,006 --> 00:07:57,074
learn features for your different movies.

224
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,099
Now given some initial set

225
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,016
of features for your movies you

226
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:02,073
can then use this first

227
00:08:03,005 --> 00:08:04,006
method that we talked about

228
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:06,018
in the previous video to try to get

229
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:08,058
an even better estimate for your parameters theta.

230
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:12,042
Now that you have a better setting of the parameters theta for your users,

231
00:08:12,086 --> 00:08:13,085
we can use that to maybe

232
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:15,013
even get a better set of

233
00:08:15,024 --> 00:08:17,011
features and so on.

234
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:18,039
We can sort of keep

235
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,043
iterating, going back and forth

236
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:21,026
and optimizing theta, x theta,

237
00:08:21,056 --> 00:08:24,000
x theta, nd this

238
00:08:24,026 --> 00:08:25,029
actually works and if you

239
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,033
do this, this will actually

240
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,036
cause your album to converge

241
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:30,043
to a reasonable set of

242
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:32,064
features for you movies and a

243
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,087
reasonable set of parameters for your different users.

244
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:38,087
So this is a basic collaborative filtering algorithm.

245
00:08:39,076 --> 00:08:40,085
This isn't actually the final

246
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:42,088
algorithm that we're going to use. In the next

247
00:08:43,012 --> 00:08:44,010
video we are going to be able to improve

248
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:45,061
on this algorithm and make

249
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,042
it quite a bit more computationally efficient.

250
00:08:48,038 --> 00:08:49,050
But, hopefully this gives you

251
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:50,060
a sense of how you

252
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:51,098
can formulate a

253
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:52,099
problem where you can simultaneously

254
00:08:53,092 --> 00:08:57,020
learn the parameters and simultaneously learn the features from the different movies.

255
00:08:58,044 --> 00:08:59,065
And for this problem, for the

256
00:08:59,074 --> 00:09:01,010
recommender system problem, this is

257
00:09:01,038 --> 00:09:02,095
possible only because each user

258
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:04,084
rates multiple movies and hopefully

259
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,040
each movie is rated

260
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,071
by multiple users. And so

261
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:10,014
you can do this back and

262
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:11,014
forth process to estimate theta

263
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,039
and x. 
So to

264
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,090
summarize, in this video we've

265
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,071
seen an initial collaborative filtering algorithm.

266
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:21,054
The term collaborative filtering refers

267
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:23,062
to the observation that when

268
00:09:23,075 --> 00:09:25,001
you run this algorithm with a

269
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:26,078
large set of users, what all

270
00:09:26,096 --> 00:09:28,040
of these users are effectively doing are sort of

271
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:31,029
collaboratively--or collaborating to

272
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:32,076
get better movie ratings for

273
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,061
everyone because with every

274
00:09:34,084 --> 00:09:36,053
user rating some subset with the movies,

275
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,003
every user is helping the

276
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:41,049
algorithm a little bit to learn better features,

277
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:44,038
and then by helping--

278
00:09:44,049 --> 00:09:46,069
by rating a few movies myself, I will be helping

279
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,054
the system learn better features and

280
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:50,075
then these features can be used

281
00:09:50,092 --> 00:09:52,061
by the system to make better

282
00:09:52,088 --> 00:09:54,037
movie predictions for everyone else.

283
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:55,045
And so there is a sense of

284
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,098
collaboration where every user is

285
00:09:57,037 --> 00:09:58,098
helping the system learn better features

286
00:09:59,036 --> 00:10:00,074
for the common good. This

287
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,045
is this collaborative filtering.

288
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:04,099
And, in the next video what we

289
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:07,049
going to do is take the ideas that

290
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:08,085
have worked out, and try to

291
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:09,090
develop a better an even

292
00:10:10,016 --> 00:10:11,091
better algorithm, a slightly better

293
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:13,063
technique for collaborative filtering.
