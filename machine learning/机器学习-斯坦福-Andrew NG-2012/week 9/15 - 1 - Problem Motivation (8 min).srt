1
00:00:00,017 --> 00:00:01,018
In this next set of videos,

2
00:00:01,072 --> 00:00:02,068
I'd like to tell you about

3
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:04,055
a problem called Anomaly Detection.

4
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,021
This is a reasonably commonly

5
00:00:07,087 --> 00:00:08,074
use you type machine learning.

6
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:10,099
And one of the interesting aspects

7
00:00:11,058 --> 00:00:13,025
is that it's mainly for

8
00:00:14,001 --> 00:00:15,085
unsupervised problem, that there's some

9
00:00:16,032 --> 00:00:17,023
aspects of it that are

10
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:20,000
also very similar to sort of the supervised learning problem.

11
00:00:21,016 --> 00:00:22,044
So, what is anomaly detection?

12
00:00:23,037 --> 00:00:25,000
To explain it. Let me use

13
00:00:25,023 --> 00:00:27,078
the motivating example of: Imagine

14
00:00:28,044 --> 00:00:30,003
that you're a manufacturer of

15
00:00:30,032 --> 00:00:32,036
aircraft engines, and let's

16
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,085
say that as your aircraft

17
00:00:34,028 --> 00:00:35,032
engines roll off the assembly

18
00:00:35,061 --> 00:00:37,057
line, you're doing, you know, QA or

19
00:00:37,082 --> 00:00:39,085
quality assurance testing, and as

20
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:41,034
part of that testing you

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,014
measure features of your

22
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,089
aircraft engine, like maybe, you measure

23
00:00:45,017 --> 00:00:46,082
the heat generated, things like

24
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:48,034
the vibrations and so on.

25
00:00:48,063 --> 00:00:49,057
I share some friends that worked

26
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:50,093
on this problem a long time

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,060
ago, and these were actually the

28
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:53,096
sorts of features that they were

29
00:00:54,046 --> 00:00:55,090
collecting off actual aircraft

30
00:00:56,028 --> 00:00:58,053
engines so you

31
00:00:58,063 --> 00:00:59,057
now have a data set of

32
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,000
X1 through Xm, if you have

33
00:01:01,075 --> 00:01:04,048
manufactured m aircraft engines,

34
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:06,073
and if you plot your data, maybe it looks like this.

35
00:01:07,012 --> 00:01:08,064
So, each point here, each cross

36
00:01:08,076 --> 00:01:10,057
here as one of your unlabeled examples.

37
00:01:11,098 --> 00:01:15,021
So, the anomaly detection problem is the following.

38
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:17,076
Let's say that on, you

39
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:18,096
know, the next day, you

40
00:01:19,014 --> 00:01:20,039
have a new aircraft engine

41
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:21,085
that rolls off the assembly line

42
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:23,089
and your new aircraft engine has

43
00:01:24,015 --> 00:01:25,043
some set of features x-test.

44
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:27,068
What the anomaly detection problem is,

45
00:01:27,093 --> 00:01:29,006
we want to know if this

46
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:31,031
aircraft engine is anomalous in

47
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:32,048
any way, in other words, we want

48
00:01:32,073 --> 00:01:34,010
to know if, maybe, this engine

49
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:36,029
should undergo further testing

50
00:01:37,032 --> 00:01:38,037
because, or if it looks

51
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,056
like an okay engine, and

52
00:01:40,073 --> 00:01:41,070
so it's okay to just ship

53
00:01:41,087 --> 00:01:43,026
it to a customer without further testing.

54
00:01:44,056 --> 00:01:45,067
So, if your new

55
00:01:45,084 --> 00:01:47,032
aircraft engine looks like

56
00:01:47,054 --> 00:01:49,015
a point over there, well, you

57
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,020
know, that looks a lot

58
00:01:50,035 --> 00:01:51,043
like the aircraft engines we've seen

59
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:53,085
before, and so maybe we'll say that it looks okay.

60
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:55,073
Whereas, if your new aircraft

61
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,039
engine, if x-test, you know, were

62
00:01:59,062 --> 00:02:00,043
a point that were out here,

63
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,026
so that if X1 and

64
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,079
X2 are the features of this new example.

65
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:06,053
If x-tests were all the

66
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,093
way out there, then we would call that an anomaly.

67
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,063
and maybe send that aircraft engine

68
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,071
for further testing before we

69
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:15,012
ship it to a customer, since

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,034
it looks very different than

71
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:20,034
the rest of the aircraft engines we've seen before.

72
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,056
More formally in the anomaly

73
00:02:22,096 --> 00:02:24,022
detection problem, we're give

74
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,015
some data sets, x1 through

75
00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:28,034
Xm of examples, and we

76
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:29,071
usually assume that these end

77
00:02:29,087 --> 00:02:32,025
examples are normal or

78
00:02:33,012 --> 00:02:34,090
non-anomalous examples, and we

79
00:02:34,097 --> 00:02:36,009
want an algorithm to tell us

80
00:02:36,028 --> 00:02:38,030
if some new example x-test is anomalous.

81
00:02:38,084 --> 00:02:40,008
The approach that we're going

82
00:02:40,012 --> 00:02:41,066
to take is that given this training

83
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:43,030
set, given the unlabeled training

84
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:45,028
set, we're going to

85
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,091
build a model for p of

86
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:48,006
x. In other words, we're

87
00:02:48,013 --> 00:02:49,031
going to build a model for the

88
00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:51,022
probability of x, where

89
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:53,033
x are these features of, say, aircraft engines.

90
00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:56,028
And so, having built a

91
00:02:56,053 --> 00:02:57,034
model of the probability of x

92
00:02:58,006 --> 00:02:59,022
we're then going to say that

93
00:02:59,081 --> 00:03:01,028
for the new aircraft engine, if

94
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:04,066
p of x-test is less

95
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:07,018
than some epsilon then

96
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:09,016
we flag this as an anomaly.

97
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,025
So we see a new engine

98
00:03:12,065 --> 00:03:13,096
that, you know, has very low probability

99
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:15,090
under a model p of

100
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:17,012
x that we estimate from the data,

101
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:19,037
then we flag this anomaly, whereas

102
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:21,087
if p of x-test is, say,

103
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:24,011
greater than or equal to some small threshold.

104
00:03:25,012 --> 00:03:26,062
Then we say that, you know, okay, it looks okay.

105
00:03:27,078 --> 00:03:28,074
And so, given the training set,

106
00:03:28,097 --> 00:03:30,088
like that plotted here, if

107
00:03:31,006 --> 00:03:31,093
you build a model, hopefully

108
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:34,002
you will find that aircraft engines,

109
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:35,050
or hopefully the model p of

110
00:03:35,056 --> 00:03:37,006
x will say that points that

111
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:38,053
lie, you know, somewhere in the

112
00:03:38,058 --> 00:03:39,055
middle, that's pretty high probability,

113
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:42,083
whereas points a little bit further out have lower probability.

114
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:45,005
Points that are even further out

115
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:47,021
have somewhat lower probability, and the

116
00:03:47,047 --> 00:03:48,041
point that's way out here,

117
00:03:49,008 --> 00:03:50,040
the point that's way

118
00:03:50,052 --> 00:03:52,009
out there, would be an anomaly.

119
00:03:54,015 --> 00:03:55,028
Whereas the point that's way in

120
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:56,046
there, right in the

121
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:57,071
middle, this would be

122
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,008
okay because p of x

123
00:03:59,037 --> 00:04:00,030
right in the middle of that

124
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:01,031
would be very high cause we've

125
00:04:01,052 --> 00:04:03,031
seen a lot of points in that region.

126
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:07,058
Here are some examples of applications of anomaly detection.

127
00:04:08,044 --> 00:04:09,099
Perhaps the most common application of

128
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:11,041
anomaly detection is actually

129
00:04:11,056 --> 00:04:13,025
for detection if you

130
00:04:13,036 --> 00:04:14,081
have many users, and if

131
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:16,036
each of your users take different

132
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:17,074
activities, you know maybe

133
00:04:17,092 --> 00:04:18,056
on your website or in the

134
00:04:18,062 --> 00:04:20,018
physical plant or something, you

135
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,067
can compute features of the different users activities.

136
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:25,073
And what you can do is build

137
00:04:25,093 --> 00:04:27,024
a model to say, you know,

138
00:04:27,031 --> 00:04:28,095
what is the probability of different

139
00:04:29,017 --> 00:04:30,073
users behaving different ways.

140
00:04:30,088 --> 00:04:32,027
What is the probability of a particular vector

141
00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:34,058
of features of a

142
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,075
users behavior so you

143
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:38,036
know examples of features of

144
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,048
a users activity may be on

145
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:41,064
the website it'd be things like,

146
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,035
maybe x1 is how often does

147
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,045
this user log in, x2, you know, maybe

148
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,092
the number of what

149
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:49,032
pages visited, or the

150
00:04:49,073 --> 00:04:51,042
number of transactions, maybe x3

151
00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:52,081
is, you know, the number of

152
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:53,099
posts of the users on the

153
00:04:54,012 --> 00:04:55,085
forum, feature x4 could

154
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,091
be what is the typing

155
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:58,066
speed of the user and some

156
00:04:58,092 --> 00:04:59,098
websites can actually track that

157
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:01,041
was the typing speed of this

158
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,000
user in characters per second.

159
00:05:03,073 --> 00:05:06,061
And so you can model p of x based on this sort of data.

160
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:09,013
And finally having your model

161
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:10,052
p of x, you can

162
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,056
try to identify users that

163
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:14,020
are behaving very strangely on your

164
00:05:14,035 --> 00:05:15,058
website by checking which ones have

165
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:18,010
probably effects less than epsilon and

166
00:05:18,024 --> 00:05:21,013
maybe send the profiles of those users for further review.

167
00:05:22,032 --> 00:05:24,056
Or demand additional identification from

168
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,018
those users, or some such

169
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:28,037
to guard against you know,

170
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:31,064
strange behavior or fraudulent behavior on your website.

171
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:34,095
This sort of technique will tend

172
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:36,047
of flag the users that are

173
00:05:36,072 --> 00:05:38,025
behaving unusually, not just

174
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,042
users that maybe behaving fraudulently.

175
00:05:42,018 --> 00:05:44,002
So not just constantly having

176
00:05:44,037 --> 00:05:45,067
stolen or users that are

177
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:47,077
trying to do funny things, or just find unusual users.

178
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,076
But this is actually the technique

179
00:05:50,004 --> 00:05:51,043
that is used by many online

180
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,056
websites that sell things to

181
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:55,086
try identify users behaving

182
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:57,089
strangely that might be

183
00:05:58,004 --> 00:05:59,016
indicative of either fraudulent

184
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:02,042
behavior or of computer accounts that have been stolen.

185
00:06:03,057 --> 00:06:06,041
Another example of anomaly detection is manufacturing.

186
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:08,047
So, already talked about the

187
00:06:08,052 --> 00:06:09,076
aircraft engine thing where you can

188
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,045
find unusual, say, aircraft

189
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:13,060
engines and send those for further review.

190
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:16,074
A third application would be

191
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:19,020
monitoring computers in a data center.

192
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:20,041
I actually have some friends who work on this too.

193
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:22,027
So if you have a lot

194
00:06:22,057 --> 00:06:23,055
of machines in a computer

195
00:06:23,073 --> 00:06:24,068
cluster or in a

196
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:25,070
data center, we can do

197
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:28,056
things like compute features at each machine.

198
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:30,064
So maybe some features capturing

199
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:32,073
you know, how much memory used, number of

200
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:34,027
disc accesses, CPU load.

201
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:36,005
As well as more complex features

202
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:37,044
like what is the CPU

203
00:06:37,082 --> 00:06:39,064
load on this machine divided by

204
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:41,033
the amount of network traffic

205
00:06:41,094 --> 00:06:43,005
on this machine?

206
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:44,057
Then given the dataset of how

207
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:45,077
your computers in your data

208
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,023
center usually behave, you can

209
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:48,045
model the probability of x,

210
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:49,073
so you can model the probability

211
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,083
of these machines having

212
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,079
different amounts of memory use

213
00:06:54,006 --> 00:06:55,019
or probability of these machines having

214
00:06:55,092 --> 00:06:57,016
different numbers of disc accesses

215
00:06:57,077 --> 00:06:59,087
or different CPU loads and so on.

216
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,010
And if you ever have a machine

217
00:07:02,002 --> 00:07:03,052
whose probability of x,

218
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,032
p of x, is very small then you

219
00:07:05,043 --> 00:07:06,087
know that machine is behaving unusually

220
00:07:07,097 --> 00:07:08,094
and maybe that machine is

221
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:11,062
about to go down, and you

222
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:13,062
can flag that for review by a system administrator.

223
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:15,088
And this is actually being used

224
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:17,080
today by various data

225
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:19,055
centers to watch out for unusual

226
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:21,043
things happening on their machines.

227
00:07:22,092 --> 00:07:24,042
So, that's anomaly detection.

228
00:07:25,054 --> 00:07:26,087
In the next video, I'll

229
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:29,039
talk a bit about the Gaussian distribution and

230
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:31,002
review properties of the Gaussian

231
00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:33,054
probability distribution, and in

232
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:34,064
videos after that, we will

233
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,038
apply it to develop an anomaly detection algorithm.
