1
00:00:00,056 --> 00:00:01,086
By now, you see the range

2
00:00:02,008 --> 00:00:04,086
of different learning algorithms. Within supervised learning,

3
00:00:05,028 --> 00:00:06,080
the performance of many supervised learning algorithms

4
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:08,083
will be pretty similar

5
00:00:09,065 --> 00:00:10,074
and when that is less more often be

6
00:00:11,003 --> 00:00:12,014
whether you use

7
00:00:12,043 --> 00:00:13,044
learning algorithm A or learning algorithm

8
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:15,001
B but when that

9
00:00:15,018 --> 00:00:16,019
is small there will often be

10
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:17,010
things like the amount of data

11
00:00:17,032 --> 00:00:18,053
you are creating these algorithms on.

12
00:00:19,028 --> 00:00:20,048
That's always your skill in

13
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,098
applying this algorithms.
Seems like

14
00:00:23,014 --> 00:00:24,048
your choice of the features that you

15
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,078
designed to give the learning

16
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:27,003
algorithms and how you

17
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:28,053
choose the regularization parameter

18
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:31,069
and things like that. But there's

19
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:34,010
one more algorithm that is very

20
00:00:34,038 --> 00:00:35,046
powerful and its very

21
00:00:35,057 --> 00:00:37,039
widely used both within industry

22
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:39,059
and in Academia. And that's called the

23
00:00:39,085 --> 00:00:41,007
support vector machine, and compared to

24
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,060
both the logistic regression and neural networks, the

25
00:00:46,077 --> 00:00:48,018
support vector machine or the SVM

26
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:50,011
sometimes gives a cleaner

27
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:52,003
and sometimes more powerful way

28
00:00:52,047 --> 00:00:53,025
of learning complex nonlinear functions.

29
00:00:53,032 --> 00:00:54,065


30
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:56,029
And so I'd like to take the next

31
00:00:56,047 --> 00:00:57,085
videos to

32
00:00:57,089 --> 00:01:00,010
talk about that.

33
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,039
Later in this course, I will do

34
00:01:01,053 --> 00:01:02,071
a quick survey of the range

35
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,034
of different supervised learning algorithms just

36
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,079
to very briefly describe them

37
00:01:07,043 --> 00:01:08,087
but the support vector machine, given

38
00:01:09,037 --> 00:01:10,084
its popularity and how popular

39
00:01:10,098 --> 00:01:11,092
it is, this will be

40
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:13,079
the last of the supervised learning algorithms

41
00:01:14,043 --> 00:01:16,070
that I'll spend a significant amount of time on in this course.

42
00:01:19,026 --> 00:01:20,043
As with our development of ever

43
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:22,028
learning algorithms, we are going to start by talking

44
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:23,093
about the optimization objective,

45
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:26,042
so let's get started on

46
00:01:26,062 --> 00:01:27,092
this algorithm.

47
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:30,095
In order to describe the support

48
00:01:31,026 --> 00:01:32,056
vector machine, I'm actually going

49
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,001
to start with logistic regression

50
00:01:34,098 --> 00:01:35,098
and show how we can modify

51
00:01:36,081 --> 00:01:37,062
it a bit and get what

52
00:01:38,023 --> 00:01:39,026
is essentially the support vector machine.

53
00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:41,073
So, in logistic regression we have

54
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:43,068
our familiar form of

55
00:01:43,073 --> 00:01:46,000
the hypotheses there and the

56
00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:48,059
sigmoid activation function shown on the right.

57
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,032
And in order to explain

58
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:52,065
some of the math, I'm going

59
00:01:52,084 --> 00:01:55,095
to use z to denote failure of transpose x here.

60
00:01:57,062 --> 00:01:58,065
Now let's think about what

61
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,015
we will like the logistic regression to do.

62
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:02,079
If we have an example with

63
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:04,035
y equals 1, and by

64
00:02:04,054 --> 00:02:05,048
this I mean an example

65
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:07,009
in either a training set

66
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:11,078
or the test set, you know, order cross valuation set where y is equal to 1 then

67
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:14,030
we are sort of hoping that h of x will be close to 1.

68
00:02:14,037 --> 00:02:15,075
So, right, we are hoping to

69
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:17,033
correctly classify that example

70
00:02:18,052 --> 00:02:19,038
and what, having h of x

71
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,071
close to 1, what that means

72
00:02:20,084 --> 00:02:22,008
is that theta transpose x

73
00:02:22,036 --> 00:02:23,037
must be much larger

74
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:24,099
than 0, so there's

75
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:26,068
greater than, greater than sign, that

76
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,021
means much, much greater

77
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:30,087
than 0 and that's

78
00:02:31,012 --> 00:02:32,084
because it is z, that is theta transpose

79
00:02:32,096 --> 00:02:34,075
x

80
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:35,090
is when z is much bigger than

81
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,024
0, is far to the

82
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,006
right of this figure that, you know, the

83
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:42,043
output of logistic regression becomes close to 1.

84
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,058
Conversely, if we have

85
00:02:45,062 --> 00:02:46,087
an example where y is

86
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,046
equal to 0 then what

87
00:02:48,075 --> 00:02:49,062
were hoping for is that the hypothesis

88
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,088
will output the value to

89
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,084
close to 0 and that corresponds to theta transpose x

90
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:55,099
or z pretty much

91
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:57,008
less than 0 because

92
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,071
that corresponds to

93
00:02:59,015 --> 00:03:01,025
hypothesis of outputting a value close to 0. If

94
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:03,059
you look at the

95
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:06,030
cost function of logistic regression, what

96
00:03:06,043 --> 00:03:07,046
you find is that each

97
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:09,040
example x, y,

98
00:03:10,018 --> 00:03:11,052
contributes a term like

99
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:14,031
this to the overall cost function.

100
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:16,090
All right. So, for the overall cost function, we usually, we will

101
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:18,059
also have a sum over

102
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:21,043
all the training examples and 1 over m term.

103
00:03:22,044 --> 00:03:22,074
But this

104
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:24,015
expression here. That's

105
00:03:24,046 --> 00:03:25,044
the term that a single

106
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:28,049
training example contributes to

107
00:03:28,078 --> 00:03:31,055
the overall objective function for logistic regression.

108
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:34,034
Now, if I take the definition

109
00:03:35,018 --> 00:03:36,012
for the full of my hypothesis

110
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:38,069
and plug it in, over here,

111
00:03:39,078 --> 00:03:40,071
the one I get is that

112
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:43,012
each training example contributes this term, right?

113
00:03:44,027 --> 00:03:45,047
Ignoring the 1 over

114
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:47,012
m but it contributes that term

115
00:03:47,046 --> 00:03:49,046
to be my overall cost function for

116
00:03:49,068 --> 00:03:52,025
logistic regression. Now let's

117
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:54,031
consider the 2 cases

118
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:55,096
of when y is equal to 1

119
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:57,025
and when y is equal to 0.

120
00:03:57,081 --> 00:03:59,003
In the first case, let's

121
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:00,025
suppose that y is equal

122
00:04:00,052 --> 00:04:01,096
to 1. In that case,

123
00:04:02,043 --> 00:04:04,084
only this first row in

124
00:04:04,097 --> 00:04:06,090
the objective matters because this

125
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:08,083
1 minus y term will be equal

126
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:10,050
to 0 if y is equal to 1.

127
00:04:13,063 --> 00:04:15,034
So, when y is equal to

128
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,012
1 when in an example, x,

129
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:18,024
y when y is equal to

130
00:04:18,042 --> 00:04:19,083
1, what we get is this

131
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,033
term minus log 1

132
00:04:21,056 --> 00:04:22,037
over 1 plus e to the negative

133
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:25,005
z. Where, similar to the last slide,

134
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,048
I'm using z to denote

135
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:29,043
data transpose x.  And

136
00:04:29,063 --> 00:04:30,093
of course, in the cost we

137
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,012
actually had this minus y

138
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:33,049
but we just said that you know, if y is

139
00:04:33,054 --> 00:04:34,079
equal to 1. So that's equal

140
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:36,050
to 1. I just simplified it

141
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:38,000
a way in the expression that

142
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,081
I have written down here.

143
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:43,002
And if we plot this function,

144
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:45,007
as a function of z, what

145
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:46,031
you find is that you get

146
00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:48,062
this curve shown on the

147
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,029
lower left of this line

148
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:52,029
and thus we also see

149
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:53,058
that when z is equal

150
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:54,093
to large that is to when

151
00:04:55,043 --> 00:04:56,093
theta transpose x is large

152
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,079
that corresponds to a

153
00:04:58,088 --> 00:04:59,089
value of z that gives

154
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,005
us a very small value, a very

155
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,064
small contribution to the

156
00:05:04,074 --> 00:05:06,012
cost function and this

157
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:07,079
kind of explains why when

158
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:10,001
logistic regression sees a positive example

159
00:05:10,063 --> 00:05:12,019
with y equals 1 it tries

160
00:05:12,086 --> 00:05:14,022
to set theta transpose x

161
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,081
to be very large because that

162
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:17,043
corresponds to this term

163
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,049
in a cost function being small. Now, to build

164
00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:23,063
the Support Vector Machine, here is what we are going to do.

165
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:24,077
We are going to take this cost function, this

166
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:29,042
minus log 1 over 1 plus e to the negative z and modify it a little bit.

167
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:32,044
Let me take this point

168
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:35,012
1 over here and let

169
00:05:36,014 --> 00:05:37,019
me draw the course function that I'm going to

170
00:05:37,027 --> 00:05:38,050
use, the new cost function is gonna

171
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,031
be flat from here on out

172
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,098
and then I'm going to draw something

173
00:05:43,017 --> 00:05:45,072
that grows as a straight

174
00:05:46,027 --> 00:05:49,023
line similar to logistic

175
00:05:49,052 --> 00:05:50,070
regression but this is going to be the

176
00:05:50,094 --> 00:05:52,074
straight line in this posh inning.

177
00:05:52,087 --> 00:05:55,004
So the curve that

178
00:05:55,018 --> 00:05:57,057
I just drew in magenta. The curve that I just drew purple and magenta.

179
00:05:58,008 --> 00:05:59,057
So, it's a pretty

180
00:05:59,073 --> 00:06:01,083
close approximation to the

181
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:03,048
cost function used by logistic

182
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:05,006
regression except that it is

183
00:06:05,012 --> 00:06:06,058
now made out of two line segments. This

184
00:06:07,049 --> 00:06:09,011
is flat potion on the right

185
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:11,058
and then this is a straight

186
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:14,033
line portion on the

187
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:16,045
left. And don't worry too much about the slope of the straight line portion.

188
00:06:16,093 --> 00:06:18,093
It doesn't matter that

189
00:06:19,018 --> 00:06:21,062
much but that's the

190
00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:23,091
new cost function we're going to use where y is equal to 1 and

191
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,024
you can imagine you

192
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:28,031
should do something pretty similar to logistic regression

193
00:06:29,018 --> 00:06:30,047
but it turns out that this will give the

194
00:06:30,075 --> 00:06:32,062
support vector machine computational advantage

195
00:06:33,068 --> 00:06:34,047
that will give us later on

196
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:37,018
an easier optimization problem, that

197
00:06:37,056 --> 00:06:39,067
will be easier for stock trades and so on.

198
00:06:41,005 --> 00:06:41,099
We just talked about the case

199
00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:43,030
of y equals to 1. The other

200
00:06:43,037 --> 00:06:44,042
case is if y is equal

201
00:06:44,066 --> 00:06:46,012
to 0. In that case,

202
00:06:47,008 --> 00:06:47,087
if you look at the cost

203
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,087
then only this second term

204
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:51,047
will apply because the first

205
00:06:51,061 --> 00:06:52,080
term goes a way

206
00:06:53,032 --> 00:06:54,049
where if y is equal to 0 then nearly

207
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:55,067
it was 0 here. So

208
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,063
your left only with the second

209
00:06:57,004 --> 00:06:58,010
term of the expression above

210
00:06:59,014 --> 00:07:00,060
and so the cost of an

211
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,095
example or the contribution

212
00:07:01,098 --> 00:07:03,062
of the cost function is going

213
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:04,085
to be given by this term

214
00:07:05,018 --> 00:07:06,062
over here and if you

215
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,086
plug that as a function

216
00:07:08,056 --> 00:07:09,075
z. So, I have here z on the

217
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:11,029
horizontal axis, you end up

218
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,037
with this group and for

219
00:07:13,047 --> 00:07:14,056
the support vector machine, once

220
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,054
again we're going to replace

221
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:17,086
this blue line with something similar

222
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,006
and see if we can

223
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:22,022
replace it with a new cost, there

224
00:07:23,048 --> 00:07:24,091
is flat out here. There's 0 out here and then

225
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:26,023
it grows as a straight

226
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:27,089
line like so.

227
00:07:29,006 --> 00:07:29,070
So, let me give

228
00:07:29,086 --> 00:07:31,094
these two functions names.

229
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:33,091
This function on the left, I'm

230
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:35,085
going to call

231
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:38,036
cost subscript 1 of z.

232
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,064
And this function on the right, I'm going to call

233
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:41,069
cost subscript 0

234
00:07:42,098 --> 00:07:44,025
of z. And the subscript just refers

235
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:46,074
to the cost corresponding to

236
00:07:47,006 --> 00:07:48,056
y is equal to 1 versus y is equal to 0.

237
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,047
Armed with these definitions, we are

238
00:07:51,057 --> 00:07:54,073
now ready to build the support vector machine.

239
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,002
Here is the cost function

240
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,023
j of theta that we have for

241
00:07:57,033 --> 00:07:58,043
logistic regression. In case

242
00:07:58,076 --> 00:07:59,075
this the equation looks a

243
00:07:59,086 --> 00:08:02,022
bit unfamiliar is because previously we

244
00:08:02,036 --> 00:08:04,026
had a minor sign outside, but

245
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,081
here what I did was I

246
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:07,000
instead moved the minor signs

247
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:08,080
inside this expression. So it

248
00:08:08,094 --> 00:08:09,092
just, you know, makes it look a

249
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:12,097
little more different. For the support

250
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:14,067
vector machine what we are

251
00:08:14,073 --> 00:08:16,055
going to do is essentially take

252
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:18,045
this, and replace this with

253
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:21,025
cost 1 of z,

254
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:23,006
that is cost 1 of theta transpose x.

255
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:25,024
I'm going

256
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,025
to take this and replace it with cost

257
00:08:28,063 --> 00:08:31,042
0 of z. This is cost 0 of

258
00:08:32,005 --> 00:08:34,009
theta transpose x

259
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:36,067
where the cost 1 function is

260
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,074
what we had on the previous

261
00:08:38,016 --> 00:08:39,092
line that looks like this and

262
00:08:40,088 --> 00:08:42,053
the cost 0 function, again what

263
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:44,041
we have on the previous line that

264
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,073
looks like this.

265
00:08:46,086 --> 00:08:48,008
So, what we have for the support

266
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,036
vector machine is an minimizationminimalization

267
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,022
problem of one of

268
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:55,021
1 over m, sum over

269
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,064
my training examples of y(i) times cost

270
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,004
1 of theta transpose

271
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:03,090
x(i) plus 1 minus

272
00:09:04,064 --> 00:09:06,063
y(i) times cost zero of theta transpose x(i).

273
00:09:07,022 --> 00:09:10,049
And then

274
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:13,047
plus my usual regularization

275
00:09:17,012 --> 00:09:23,027
parameter like so. Now

276
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:25,027
by convention for the Support

277
00:09:25,057 --> 00:09:27,061
Vector Machine, we actually write

278
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:29,050
things slightly differently. We parametrize

279
00:09:30,057 --> 00:09:31,069
this just very slightly differently.

280
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:33,072
First, we're going

281
00:09:34,012 --> 00:09:35,036
to get rid of the 1

282
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:36,086
over m terms and this just,

283
00:09:37,012 --> 00:09:38,048
this just happens

284
00:09:38,076 --> 00:09:40,037
to be a slightly different convention that people

285
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:41,092
use for support vector machines

286
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:43,039
compared to for logistic regression. But here's what

287
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:46,017
I mean, you know, what I'm going

288
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:47,096
to do is I am just gonna get

289
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,045
rid  of this 1 over m

290
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:50,086
terms and this should give

291
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,002
me the same optimal value for theta, right.

292
00:09:53,062 --> 00:09:55,001
Because 1 over m is just a constant.

293
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,054
So, you know, whether I solve

294
00:09:57,092 --> 00:09:59,040
this minimization problem with 1

295
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:00,042
over m in front or not,

296
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,000
I should end up with the same

297
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:03,050
optimal value of theta.

298
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:05,045
Here is what I mean, to

299
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:07,000
give you a concrete example,

300
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,016
suppose I had a minimization

301
00:10:09,037 --> 00:10:11,003
problem that you know minimize over

302
00:10:11,046 --> 00:10:14,070
a real number u of u minus 5 squared,

303
00:10:17,008 --> 00:10:18,053
plus 1, right. Well, the

304
00:10:18,062 --> 00:10:20,003
minimum of this happens, happens

305
00:10:20,044 --> 00:10:21,089
to know the minimum of this is u equals 5.

306
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:23,098
Now if I want to take

307
00:10:24,012 --> 00:10:25,079
this objective function and multiply

308
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,024
it by 10, so

309
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:29,085
here my minimization problem is

310
00:10:30,057 --> 00:10:33,050
minimum of u of 10, u minus

311
00:10:33,096 --> 00:10:35,026
5 squared plus 10.

312
00:10:35,091 --> 00:10:37,064
Well the value of u

313
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:40,035
that minimizes this is still u equals 5, right.

314
00:10:40,094 --> 00:10:42,053
So, multiplying something that

315
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:44,015
you are minimizing over by some

316
00:10:44,036 --> 00:10:45,053
constant, 10 in this case,

317
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,071
it does not change the value

318
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:51,045
of u that gives us, that minimizes this function.

319
00:10:52,064 --> 00:10:53,067
So the same way what I've

320
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,012
done by crossing out this

321
00:10:55,042 --> 00:10:56,094
m is, all I

322
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:58,076
am doing is multiplying my objective

323
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:00,064
function by some constant m

324
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,091
and it doesn't change the value

325
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,030
of theta that achieves the minimum.

326
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:07,019
The second bit of notational change,

327
00:11:07,047 --> 00:11:08,055
we're just designating the most

328
00:11:08,074 --> 00:11:10,062
standard convention, when using as

329
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:13,025
the SVM, instead of logistic regression as a following.

330
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:15,087
So, for logistic regression, we had

331
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,026
two terms to our objective function.

332
00:11:19,034 --> 00:11:20,050
The first is this term

333
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:22,001
which is the cost that comes

334
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:23,090
from the training set and the

335
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,073
second is this term, which

336
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:28,033
is the regularization term

337
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:29,046
and what we had, we had to

338
00:11:29,087 --> 00:11:30,089
control the trade off between

339
00:11:31,026 --> 00:11:32,060
these by saying, you know, that we

340
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,075
wanted to minimize A plus

341
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:38,024
and then my regularization parameter lambda,

342
00:11:39,037 --> 00:11:42,027
and then times some other

343
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:43,042
term B, right? Where as I

344
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,097
am using A to denote

345
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,015
this first term, and I am

346
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,027
using B to denote that

347
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:49,055
second term, may be without the

348
00:11:49,064 --> 00:11:52,044
lambda, and instead of

349
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:56,009
prioritizing this as A plus lambda B,

350
00:11:56,026 --> 00:11:57,095
we could, and so what we

351
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,066
did was by setting different

352
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,021
values for this regularization parameter lambda.

353
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:04,017
We could trade off the relative

354
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:05,072
way between how much we

355
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:06,077
want to fit the training set well,

356
00:12:07,055 --> 00:12:09,038
as minimizing A, versus how

357
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,092
much we care about keeping the values of the parameters small.

358
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:14,052
So that would be

359
00:12:14,063 --> 00:12:16,016
for the parameters B. For the Support

360
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:17,062
Vector Machine, just by convention

361
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:19,014
we're going to use a different

362
00:12:19,057 --> 00:12:21,096
parameter. So instead of using lambda here

363
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:23,022
to control the relative

364
00:12:23,063 --> 00:12:24,073
waiting between you know, the first and second terms,

365
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,025
we are

366
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:27,037
still going to use a different

367
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:29,007
parameter which by convention

368
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:31,052
is called C and

369
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:33,054
we instead are going to minimize C times

370
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:39,015
A plus B. So

371
00:12:39,037 --> 00:12:41,021
for logistic regression if we

372
00:12:41,034 --> 00:12:42,073
send a very large value of

373
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:43,098
lambda, that means to give

374
00:12:44,025 --> 00:12:45,097
B a very high weight. Here

375
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,063
is that if we set C

376
00:12:47,096 --> 00:12:49,075
to be a very small value. That

377
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:51,050
corresponds to giving B

378
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:53,052
much larger weight than C than A.

379
00:12:54,061 --> 00:12:55,073
So this is just a different

380
00:12:55,088 --> 00:12:57,033
way of controlling the trade off

381
00:12:57,062 --> 00:12:58,097
or just a different way of

382
00:12:59,005 --> 00:13:01,052
parametrizing how much we care about optimizing the first term versus how much we care about optimizing the second term.

383
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,086


384
00:13:03,003 --> 00:13:04,088


385
00:13:05,028 --> 00:13:06,025
And if you want you can

386
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:07,062
think of this as the parameter

387
00:13:08,017 --> 00:13:09,058
C playing a role

388
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,057
similar to 1 over

389
00:13:11,088 --> 00:13:13,089
lambda and it's

390
00:13:14,008 --> 00:13:16,010
not that it's two equations

391
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:17,089
or these two expressions will be

392
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,050
equal, it's equals 1 over

393
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:21,035
lambda and it's not that these two equations or these two expressions will be equal. It's equals t 1 over lambda. That's not the case where it bothers that if C is equal to 1 over lambda then

394
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:24,050
these

395
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:26,066
two optimization objectives should

396
00:13:26,094 --> 00:13:28,025
give you the same value, same

397
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,046
optimal value of theta.
So

398
00:13:30,035 --> 00:13:31,017
just filling that

399
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:33,002
in. I'm gonna cross out lambda here

400
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:34,094
and write in the constant C there.

401
00:13:35,002 --> 00:13:37,092
So,that's gives

402
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:40,083
us our overall optimization objective

403
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:42,064
function for the Support Vector

404
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:43,097
Machine and where you

405
00:13:44,008 --> 00:13:46,020
minimize that function then what

406
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,040
you have is the parameters

407
00:13:48,023 --> 00:13:52,079
learned by SVM.
Finally on

408
00:13:52,094 --> 00:13:54,069
light of logistic regression, the Support

409
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,011
Vector Machine doesn't output the

410
00:13:56,022 --> 00:13:57,085
probability. Instead what we

411
00:13:57,097 --> 00:13:58,090
have is, we have this cost

412
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:00,060
function which we minimize to

413
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:02,076
get the parameters theta and what

414
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,089
the Support Vector Machine does,

415
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:05,097
is it just makes the prediction

416
00:14:07,004 --> 00:14:08,064
of y being equal 1

417
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:10,038
or 0 directly. So the hypothesis,

418
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,091
where I predict, 1, if

419
00:14:14,014 --> 00:14:15,062
theta transpose x is

420
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,067
greater than or equal to

421
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,005
0 and I'll predict 0 otherwise.

422
00:14:20,032 --> 00:14:21,055
And so, having learned the

423
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:23,000
parameters theta, this is

424
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:25,098
the form of the hypothesis for the support vector machine.

425
00:14:26,085 --> 00:14:27,087
So, that was a

426
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:29,066
mathematical definition of what

427
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:31,051
a support vector machine does.

428
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:32,087
In the next few videos, let's

429
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:33,089
try to get back to

430
00:14:34,025 --> 00:14:36,002
intuition about what this

431
00:14:36,048 --> 00:14:37,065
optimization objective leads to and

432
00:14:37,082 --> 00:14:38,084
whether the source of the hypothesis

433
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:41,029
a SVM will learn and also

434
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,005
talk about how to modify

435
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,063
this just a little bit to

436
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,027
learn complex, nonlinear functions.
