00:00:00,096 --> 00:00:05,068
In this video, lets delve deeper and get
even better intuition about what the cost

2
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:10,052
function is doing. This video assumes that
you're familiar with contour plots. If you

3
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:15,018
are not familiar with contour plots or
contour figures some of the illustrations

4
00:00:15,018 --> 00:00:20,014
in this video may or may not make sense to
you but is okay and if you end up skipping

5
00:00:20,014 --> 00:00:24,052
this video or some of it does not quite
make sense because you haven't seen

6
00:00:24,052 --> 00:00:29,024
contour plots before. That's okay and you will
still understand the rest of this course

7
00:00:29,024 --> 00:00:34,093
without those parts of this. Here's our
problem formulation as usual, with the

8
00:00:34,093 --> 00:00:39,088
hypothesis parameters, cost function, and
our optimization objective. Unlike

9
00:00:39,088 --> 00:00:45,016
before, unlike the last video, I'm
going to keep both of my parameters, theta

10
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:50,057
zero, and theta one, as we generate our
visualizations for the cost function. So, same

11
00:00:50,057 --> 00:00:57,020
as last time, we want to understand the
hypothesis H and the cost function J. So,

12
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:04,016
here's my training set of housing prices
and let's make some hypothesis. You know,

13
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:10,021
like that one, this is not a particularly
good hypothesis. But, if I set theta

14
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:16,026
zero=50 and theta one=0.06, then I end up
with this hypothesis down here and that

15
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:22,018
corresponds to that straight line. Now given
these value of theta zero and theta one,

16
00:01:22,018 --> 00:01:27,051
we want to plot the corresponding, you
know, cost function on the right. What we

17
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:33,015
did last time was, right, when we only had
theta one. In other words, drawing plots

18
00:01:33,015 --> 00:01:37,081
that look like this as a function of theta
one. But now we have two parameters, theta

19
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:42,034
zero, and theta one, and so the plot gets
a little more complicated. It turns out

20
00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:47,069
that when we have only one parameter, that
the parts we drew had this sort of bow

21
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:52,092
shaped function. Now, when we have two
parameters, it turns out the cost function

22
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:58,021
also has a similar sort of bow shape. And,
in fact, depending on your training set,

23
00:01:58,021 --> 00:02:03,051
you might get a cost function that maybe
looks something like this. So, this is a

24
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:09,040
3-D surface plot, where the axes
are labeled theta zero and theta one. So

25
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:15,032
as you vary theta zero and theta one, the two
parameters, you get different values of the

26
00:02:15,032 --> 00:02:20,096
cost function J (theta zero, theta one)
and the height of this surface above a

27
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:26,034
particular point of theta zero, theta one.
Right, that's, that's the vertical axis. The

28
00:02:26,034 --> 00:02:31,019
height of the surface of the points
indicates the value of J of theta zero, J

29
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:36,047
of theta one. And you can see it sort of
has this bow like shape. Let me show you

30
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:46,035
the same plot in 3D. So here's the same
figure in 3D, horizontal axis theta one and

31
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:52,012
vertical axis J(theta zero, theta one), and if I rotate
this plot around. You kinda of a

32
00:02:52,012 --> 00:02:57,060
get a sense, I hope, of this bowl
shaped surface as that's what the cost

33
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:03,059
function J looks like. Now for the purpose
of illustration in the rest of this video

34
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:09,007
I'm not actually going to use these sort
of 3D surfaces to show you the cost

35
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:16,047
function J, instead I'm going to use
contour plots. Or what I also call contour

36
00:03:16,047 --> 00:03:24,074
figures. I guess they mean the same thing.
To show you these surfaces. So here's an

37
00:03:24,074 --> 00:03:31,013
example of a contour figure, shown on the
right, where the axis are theta zero and

38
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:37,060
theta one. And what each of these ovals,
what each of these ellipsis shows is a set

39
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:43,075
of points that takes on the same value for
J(theta zero, theta one). So

40
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:50,051
concretely, for example this, you'll take
that point and that point and that point.

41
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:55,058
All three of these points that I just
drew in magenta, they have the same value

42
00:03:55,058 --> 00:03:59,072
for J (theta zero, theta one). Okay.
Where, right, these, this is the theta

43
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:04,077
zero, theta one axis but those three have
the same Value for J (theta zero, theta one)

44
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:10,021
and if you haven't seen contour
plots much before think of, imagine if you

45
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:14,099
will. A bow shaped function that's coming
out of my screen. So that the minimum, so

46
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:19,066
the bottom of the bow is this point right
there, right? This middle, the middle of

47
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:24,028
these concentric ellipses. And imagine a
bow shape that sort of grows out of my

48
00:04:24,028 --> 00:04:28,078
screen like this, so that each of these
ellipses, you know, has the same height

49
00:04:28,078 --> 00:04:33,034
above my screen. And the minimum with the
bow, right, is right down there. And so

50
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:37,078
the contour figures is a, is way to,
is maybe a more convenient way to

51
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:45,018
visualize my function J. [sound] So, let's
look at some examples. Over here, I have a

52
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:53,027
particular point, right? And so this is,
with, you know, theta zero equals maybe

53
00:04:53,027 --> 00:05:01,096
about 800, and theta one equals maybe a
-0.15 . And so this point, right, this

54
00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:07,032
point in red corresponds to one
set of pair values of theta zero, theta one

55
00:05:07,032 --> 00:05:12,009
and the corresponding, in fact, to that
hypothesis, right, theta zero is

56
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:17,018
about 800, that is, where it intersects
the vertical axis is around 800, and this is

57
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:21,076
slope of about -0.15. Now this line is
really not such a good fit to the

58
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:26,085
data, right. This hypothesis, h(x), with these values of theta zero,

59
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:32,028
theta one, it's really not such a good fit
to the data. And so you find that, it's

60
00:05:32,028 --> 00:05:37,053
cost. Is a value that's out here that's
you know pretty far from the minimum right

61
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:42,090
it's pretty far this is a pretty high cost
because this is just not that good a fit

62
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:47,024
to the data. Let's look at some more
examples. Now here's a different

63
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:52,048
hypothesis that's you know still not a
great fit for the data but may be slightly

64
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:57,098
better so here right that's my point that
those are my parameters theta zero theta

65
00:05:57,098 --> 00:06:07,038
one and so my theta zero value. Right?
That's bout 360 and my value for theta

66
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:14,004
one. Is equal to zero. So, you know, let's
break it out. Let's take theta zero equals

67
00:06:14,004 --> 00:06:20,006
360 theta one equals zero. And this pair
of parameters corresponds to that

68
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:26,016
hypothesis, corresponds to flat line, that is, h(x) equals 360 plus zero

69
00:06:26,016 --> 00:06:32,042
times x. So that's the hypothesis. And
this hypothesis again has some cost, and

70
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:38,060
that cost is, you know, plotted as the
height of the J function at that point.

71
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:44,088
Let's look at just a couple of examples.
Here's one more, you know, at this value

72
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:52,023
of theta zero, and at that value of theta
one, we end up with this hypothesis, h(x)

73
00:06:52,023 --> 00:06:58,059
and again, not a great fit to the data,
and is actually further away from the minimum. Last example, this is

74
00:06:58,059 --> 00:07:03,044
actually not quite at the minimum, but
it's pretty close to the minimum. So this

75
00:07:03,044 --> 00:07:08,048
is not such a bad fit to the, to the data,
where, for a particular value, of, theta

76
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:13,033
zero. Which, one of them has value, as in
for a particular value for theta one. We

77
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:18,000
get a particular h(x). And this is, this
is not quite at the minimum, but it's

78
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,003
pretty close. And so the sum of squares
errors is sum of squares distances between

79
00:07:23,003 --> 00:07:28,025
my, training samples and my hypothesis.
Really, that's a sum of square distances,

80
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:32,054
right? Of all of these errors. This is
pretty close to the minimum even though

81
00:07:32,054 --> 00:07:37,009
it's not quite the minimum. So with these
figures I hope that gives you a better

82
00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:41,086
understanding of what values of the cost
function J, how they are and how that

83
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:47,032
corresponds to different hypothesis and so as
how better hypotheses may corresponds to points

84
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:52,098
that are closer to the minimum of this cost
function J. Now of course what we really

85
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:57,061
want is an efficient algorithm, right, a
efficient piece of software for

86
00:07:57,061 --> 00:08:02,021
automatically finding The value of theta
zero and theta one, that minimizes the

87
00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:06,056
cost function J, right? And what we, what
we don't wanna do is to, you know, how to

88
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:10,069
write software, to plot out this point,
and then try to manually read off the

89
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:15,026
numbers, that this is not a good way to do
it. And, in fact, we'll see it later, that

90
00:08:15,042 --> 00:08:19,093
when we look at more complicated examples,
we'll have high dimensional figures with

91
00:08:19,093 --> 00:08:23,090
more parameters, that, it turns out,
we'll see in a few, we'll see later in

92
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:28,009
this course, examples where this figure,
you know, cannot really be plotted, and

93
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:33,066
this becomes much harder to visualize. And
so, what we want is to have software

94
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:37,072
to find the value of theta zero, theta one
that minimizes this function and

95
00:08:37,091 --> 00:08:42,091
in the next video we start to talk about
an algorithm for automatically finding

96
00:08:42,091 --> 00:08:47,060
that value of theta zero and theta one
that minimizes the cost function J.
