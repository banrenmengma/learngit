00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,026
Welcome to this free online class on
machine learning. Machine learning is one

2
00:00:04,026 --> 00:00:08,057
of the most exciting recent technologies.
And in this class, you learn about the

3
00:00:08,057 --> 00:00:13,011
state of the art and also gain practice
implementing and deploying these algorithms

4
00:00:13,011 --> 00:00:17,048
yourself. You've probably use a learning
algorithm dozens of times a day without

5
00:00:17,048 --> 00:00:21,042
knowing it. Every time you use a web
search engine like Google or Bing to

6
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:25,079
search the internet, one of the reasons
that works so well is because a learning

7
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:30,000
algorithm, one implemented by Google or
Microsoft, has learned how to rank web

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,014
pages. Every time you use Facebook or
Apple's photo typing application and it

9
00:00:35,014 --> 00:00:40,059
recognizes your friends' photos, that's
also machine learning. Every time you read

10
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:46,005
your email and your spam filter saves you
from having to wade through tons of spam

11
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:50,097
email, that's also a learning algorithm.
For me one of the reasons I'm excited is

12
00:00:50,097 --> 00:00:55,064
the AI dream of someday building machines
as intelligent as you or me. We're a long

13
00:00:55,064 --> 00:01:00,007
way away from that goal, but many AI
researchers believe that the best way to

14
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:04,056
towards that goal is through learning
algorithms that try to mimic how the human

15
00:01:04,056 --> 00:01:08,099
brain learns. I'll tell you a little bit
about that too in this class. In this

16
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:13,054
class you learn about state-of-the-art
machine learning algorithms. But it turns

17
00:01:13,054 --> 00:01:17,091
out just knowing the algorithms and
knowing the math isn't that much good if

18
00:01:17,091 --> 00:01:22,046
you don't also know how to actually get
this stuff to work on problems that you

19
00:01:22,046 --> 00:01:26,084
care about. So, we've also spent a lot
of time developing exercises for you to

20
00:01:26,084 --> 00:01:32,008
implement each of these algorithms and
see how they work fot yourself. So why is

21
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:37,007
machine learning so prevalent today?
It turns out that machine learning is a

22
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:41,071
field that had grown out of the field of
AI, or artificial intelligence. We wanted

23
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:46,064
to build intelligent machines and it turns
out that there are a few basic things that

24
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:51,045
we could program a machine to do such as
how to find the shortest path from A to B.

25
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:56,026
But for the most part we just did not know
how to write AI programs to do the more

26
00:01:56,026 --> 00:02:00,090
interesting things such as web search or
photo tagging or email anti-spam. There

27
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,071
was a realization that the only way to do
these things was to have a machine learn

28
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:11,023
to do it by itself. So, machine learning
was developed as a new capability for

29
00:02:11,023 --> 00:02:16,094
computers and today it touches many
segments of industry and basic science.

30
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:21,049
For me, I work on machine learning and
in a typical week I might end up talking to

31
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:25,069
helicopter pilots, biologists, a bunch
of computer systems people (so my

32
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:30,059
colleagues here at Stanford) and averaging
two or three times a week I get email from

33
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:35,002
people in industry from Silicon Valley
contacting me who have an interest in

34
00:02:35,002 --> 00:02:39,074
applying learning algorithms to their own
problems. This is a sign of the range of

35
00:02:39,074 --> 00:02:44,000
problems that machine learning touches.
There is autonomous robotics, computational

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,077
biology, tons of things in Silicon Valley
that machine learning is having an impact

37
00:02:48,077 --> 00:02:55,031
on. Here are some other examples of
machine learning. There's database mining.

38
00:02:55,031 --> 00:03:00,006
One of the reasons machine learning has so
pervaded is the growth of the web and the

39
00:03:00,006 --> 00:03:04,075
growth of automation All this means that
we have much larger data sets than ever

40
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:09,027
before. So, for example tons of Silicon
Valley companies are today collecting web

41
00:03:09,027 --> 00:03:13,073
click data, also called clickstream data,
and are trying to use machine learning

42
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:18,048
algorithms to mine this data to understand
the users better and to serve the users

43
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:22,032
better, that's a huge segment of
Silicon Valley right now. Medical

44
00:03:22,032 --> 00:03:27,048
records. With the advent of automation, we
now have electronic medical records, so if

45
00:03:27,048 --> 00:03:32,063
we can turn medical records into medical
knowledge, then we can start to understand

46
00:03:32,063 --> 00:03:37,023
disease better. Computational biology.
With automation again, biologists are

47
00:03:37,023 --> 00:03:41,077
collecting lots of data about gene
sequences, DNA sequences, and so on, and

48
00:03:41,077 --> 00:03:46,093
machines running algorithms are giving us
a much better understanding of the human

49
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:51,037
genome, and what it means to be human.
And in engineering as well, in all fields of

50
00:03:51,037 --> 00:03:55,003
engineering, we have larger and larger,
and larger and larger data sets, that

51
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:59,024
we're trying to understand using learning
algorithms. A second range of machinery

52
00:03:59,024 --> 00:04:03,043
applications is ones that we cannot
program by hand. So for example, I've

53
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:08,032
worked on autonomous helicopters for many
years. We just did not know how to write a

54
00:04:08,032 --> 00:04:18,002
computer program to make this helicopter
fly by itself. The only thing that worked

55
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:35,057
was having a computer learn by itself how
to fly this helicopter. [Helicopter whirling]

56
00:04:37,012 --> 00:04:42,087
Handwriting recognition. It turns out one
of the reasons it's so inexpensive today to

57
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:47,032
route a piece of mail across the
countries, in the US and internationally,

58
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:51,089
is that when you write an envelope like
this, it turns out there's a learning

59
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:56,094
algorithm that has learned how to read your
handwriting so that it can automatically

60
00:04:56,094 --> 00:05:01,074
route this envelope on its way, and so it
costs us a few cents to send this thing

61
00:05:01,074 --> 00:05:06,031
thousands of miles. And in fact if you've
seen the fields of natural language

62
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:10,053
processing or computer vision,
these are the fields of AI pertaining to

63
00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:15,032
understanding language or understanding
images. Most of natural language processing

64
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:20,068
and most of computer vision today is
applied machine learning. Learning

65
00:05:20,068 --> 00:05:25,057
algorithms are also widely used for self-
customizing programs. Every time you go to

66
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:30,028
Amazon or Netflix or iTunes Genius, and it
recommends the movies or products and

67
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:35,007
music to you, that's a learning algorithm.
If you think about it they have million

68
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:39,099
users; there is no way to write a million
different programs for your million users.

69
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:44,080
The only way to have software give these
customized recommendations is to become

70
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,025
learn by itself to customize itself to
your preferences. Finally learning

71
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:53,029
algorithms are being used today to
understand human learning and to

72
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:58,004
understand the brain. We'll talk about
how researches are using this to make

73
00:05:58,004 --> 00:06:03,018
progress towards the big AI dream. A few
months ago, a student showed me an article

74
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:07,099
on the top twelve IT skills. The skills
that information technology hiring

75
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:13,000
managers cannot say no to. It was a
slightly older article, but at the top of

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,098
this list of the twelve most desirable IT
skills was machine learning. Here at

77
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:21,079
Stanford, the number of recruiters
that contact me asking if I know any

78
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:25,092
graduating machine learning students
is far larger than the machine learning

79
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:30,004
students we graduate each year. So I
think there is a vast, unfulfilled demand

80
00:06:30,004 --> 00:06:34,027
for this skill set, and this is a great time to
be learning about machine learning, and I

81
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:38,045
hope to teach you a lot about machine
learning in this class. In the next video,

82
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:42,012
we'll start to give a more formal
definition of what is machine learning.

83
00:06:42,012 --> 00:06:46,004
And we'll begin to talk about the main
types of machine learning problems and

84
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:49,086
algorithms. You'll pick up some of the
main machine learning terminology, and

85
00:06:49,086 --> 00:06:53,068
start to get a sense of what are the
different algorithms, and when each one

86
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:54,074
might be appropriate.
