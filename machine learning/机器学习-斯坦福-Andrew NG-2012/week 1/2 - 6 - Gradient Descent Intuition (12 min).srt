1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,035
In the previous video, we gave a
mathematical definition of gradient

2
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:09,046
descent. Let's delve deeper, and in this
video, get better intuition about what the

3
00:00:09,046 --> 00:00:14,070
algorithm is doing, and why the steps of
the gradient descent algorithm might make

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,063
sense. Here's the gradient descent
algorithm that we saw last time. And, just

5
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:26,042
to remind you, this parameter, or this
term, alpha, is called the learning rate.

6
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:32,044
And it controls how big a step we take
when updating my parameter theta J. And

7
00:00:32,044 --> 00:00:41,035
this second term here is the derivative
term. And what I want to do in this video

8
00:00:41,035 --> 00:00:47,035
is give you better intuition about what each of
these two terms is doing and why, when put

9
00:00:47,035 --> 00:00:53,007
together, this entire update makes sense.
In order to convey these intuitions, what

10
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:58,046
I want to do is use a slightly simpler
example where we want to minimize The

11
00:00:58,046 --> 00:01:03,002
function of just one parameter. So, so we
have a, say we have cause function J of

12
00:01:03,002 --> 00:01:07,029
just one parameter, theta one, like we
did, you know, a few videos back. Where

13
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:11,091
theta one is a real number, okay? Just so we can have 1D plots, which

14
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:16,041
are a little bit simpler to look at. And
let's try to understand why grade and

15
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:23,093
descent would do on this function.
[sound]. So, let's say here's my function.

16
00:01:24,065 --> 00:01:31,069
J of theta one, and so that's my, and
where theta one is a real number. Right,

17
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:39,020
now let's say I've initialized gradient
descent with theta one at this location.

18
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:46,098
So image that we start off at that point
on my function. What gradient descent will

19
00:01:46,098 --> 00:01:56,093
do, is it will update. Theta one gets
updated as Theta one minus Alpha times DD

20
00:01:56,093 --> 00:02:04,069
Theta one J L. Theta one right and oh an
just as an aside you know this, this

21
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:11,063
derivative term right if, if Your
wondering why I changed the notation from

22
00:02:11,063 --> 00:02:16,013
these partial derivative symbols. If you
don't know what the difference is between

23
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:20,052
these partial derivative symbols and the
dd theta don't worry about it. Technically

24
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:24,049
in mathematics we call this a partial
derivative, we call this a derivative,

25
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:28,029
depending on the number of, of parameters
in the function J, but that's a

26
00:02:28,029 --> 00:02:32,042
mathematical technicality, so, you know
For the purpose of this lecture, think of

27
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:36,076
these partial symbols, and DD theta one as
exactly the same thing. And, don't worry

28
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:41,005
about whether there are any differences.
I'm gonna try to use the mathematically

29
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:45,018
precise notation. But for our purposes,
these notations are really the same thing.

30
00:02:45,036 --> 00:02:49,062
So, let's see what this, this equation
will do. And so we're going to compute

31
00:02:49,062 --> 00:02:54,029
this derivative of, I'm not sure if you've
seen derivatives in calculus before. But

32
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:58,066
what a derivative, at this point, does, is
basically saying, you know, let's. Take

33
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:02,087
the tangent to that point, like that
straight line, the red line, just,

34
00:03:02,087 --> 00:03:06,097
just touching this function and
let's look at the slope of this red line. That's

35
00:03:06,097 --> 00:03:11,035
where the derivative is. It says
what's the slope of the line that is just

36
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:15,056
tangent to the function, okay, and the
slope of the line is of course is just

37
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:20,078
right, you know just the height divided by
this horizontal thing. Now. This line has

38
00:03:20,078 --> 00:03:28,037
a positive slope, so it has a positive
derivative. And so, my update to theta is

39
00:03:28,037 --> 00:03:36,025
going to be, theta one gives [inaudible]
data one minus alpha times some positive

40
00:03:36,025 --> 00:03:43,010
number. >> Okay. However, the learning
rate is always a positive number. And so

41
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:47,093
I'm gonna to take theta one, this update
as theta one minus something. So I'm gonna

42
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:52,064
end up moving theta one to the left. I'm
gonna decrease theta one and we can see

43
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:57,047
this is the right thing to do because I
actually went ahead in this direction you

44
00:03:57,047 --> 00:04:02,058
know to get me closer to the minimum over
there. So, gradient descent so far seems

45
00:04:02,058 --> 00:04:08,011
to be doing the right thing. Let's look at
another example. So let's take my same

46
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:13,078
function j. Just trying to draw the same
function j of theta one. And now let's say

47
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:19,018
I had instead initialized my parameter
over there on the left. So theta one is

48
00:04:19,018 --> 00:04:24,016
here. I'm gonna add that point on the
surface. Now, my derivative term, d, d

49
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:29,056
theta one j of theta one, when evaluated
at this point, gonna look at right. The

50
00:04:29,056 --> 00:04:35,003
slope of that line. So this derivative
term is a slope of this line. But this

51
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:42,074
line is slanting down, so this line has
negative slope. Right? Or alternatively I

52
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:48,071
say that this function has negative
derivative, just means negative slope at

53
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:54,076
that point. So this is less than equal to
zero. So when I update theta, then if

54
00:04:54,076 --> 00:05:02,083
theta is updated as theta minus alpha at
times a negative number. And so I have

55
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:07,088
theta one minus a negative number which
means I'm actually going to increase data,

56
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:13,010
right? Because this is minus of a negative
number means I'm adding something to theta

57
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:17,089
and what that means is that I'm going to
end up increasing theta. And so we'll

58
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:23,000
start here and increase theta, which again
seems like the thing I want to do to try

59
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,033
to get me closer to the minimum. So, this
hopefully explains the intuition behind

60
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:33,087
what the derivative term is doing. Let's
[inaudible] looking at the learning on

61
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:39,095
alpha, and try to figure out what that's
doing. So, here's my greater descent

62
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:46,064
update rule. Right, there's this equation
And let's look at what can happen, if

63
00:05:46,064 --> 00:05:52,084
Alpha is either too small, or if Alpha is
too large. So this first example, what

64
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:59,058
happens if Alpha is too small. So here's
my function j. [inaudible] theta. Lets

65
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:04,023
just start here. If alpha is too small
then what I'm going to do is gonna

66
00:06:04,023 --> 00:06:09,032
multiply the [inaudible] by some small
number. So end up taking [inaudible] step

67
00:06:09,032 --> 00:06:13,084
like that. Okay, so that's one step
[inaudible]. Then from this new point

68
00:06:13,084 --> 00:06:18,087
we're gonna take another step [inaudible]
alpha is too small lets take another

69
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:25,034
little baby step. And so if And so if my
learning rate is too small. I'm gonna end

70
00:06:25,034 --> 00:06:30,058
up you know. Taking these tiny, tiny baby
steps. To try to get the minimum and I'm

71
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:35,083
gonna need. A lot of steps to get to the
minimum and so. If alpha's too small, can

72
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:41,001
be slow because it's gonna take these
tiny, tiny baby steps. And it's gonna need

73
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:45,082
a lot of steps before it gets any where
close to the global minimum. Now,

74
00:06:45,082 --> 00:06:52,023
[inaudible] to lodge. So here's the
function of my [inaudible] data. Since f

75
00:06:52,023 --> 00:06:57,058
is too large, then grading the sense can
overshoot a minimum and may even yet

76
00:06:57,058 --> 00:07:03,036
converge or even diverge. [inaudible] such
ireful minimum So the derivative council

77
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:08,064
right that if office is too big take a
huge step, take a huge step like that

78
00:07:08,064 --> 00:07:14,013
[inaudible], and the take a huge step and
now the cross functions are strongest,

79
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:20,005
start off with this value but now my value
has gone downwards. Now my derivatives you

80
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:25,018
know points to the left assess the weakly
data. But if my learning area is to big I

81
00:07:25,018 --> 00:07:29,079
may take a few stabs going from here all
the way out there so I end up. Being all

82
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:35,037
there. Right? And if my learning was to
big I can take another huge step on the

83
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:41,003
next acceleration and kind of overshoot
and overshoot and so on until you notice

84
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:46,076
I'm actually getting further and further
away from the minimum. And so if alpha is

85
00:07:46,076 --> 00:07:51,090
to large it can fail to converge or even
diverge. Now. I have another question for

86
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:56,005
you. So, this is a tricky one. And when I
was first learning this stuff, it actually

87
00:07:56,005 --> 00:08:00,000
took me a long time to figure this out.
What if your pre-emptive theta one is

88
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,010
already at a local minimum? What do you
think one step of grade and descent will

89
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:10,085
do? So let's suppose you initialize data
one at a local minimum. So you know

90
00:08:10,085 --> 00:08:16,071
suppose this is your initial value of 01
over here and it's already at a local

91
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:22,071
optimum and the local minimum. It sends
out that at local optimum your derivative

92
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:28,079
would be equal to zero. Since it's that
slope where it's that tangent point so the

93
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:35,052
slope of this line will be equal to zero
and thus this derivative term. Is equal to

94
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:40,094
zero. And so, in your grade and descent
update, you have theta one, [inaudible]

95
00:08:40,094 --> 00:08:46,028
this theta one, minus alpha times zero.
And so, what this means is that, if you're

96
00:08:46,028 --> 00:08:51,022
already at a local optimum, it leaves
theta one unchanged. ?Cause, you know,

97
00:08:51,022 --> 00:08:56,013
[inaudible] theta one. Equals theta one.
So if your parameter is already at a local

98
00:08:56,013 --> 00:09:00,069
minimum, one step of grade and descent
does absolutely nothing. It doesn't change

99
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:05,025
the parameter, which is, which is what you
want. Cuz it keeps your solution at the

100
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:09,070
local optimum. This also explains why
grade and descent can converse the local

101
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:14,032
minimum, even with the learning rate Alpha
fixed. Here's what I mean by that. Let's

102
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:21,054
look at an example. So here's a cost
function J. With data. That maybe I want

103
00:09:21,054 --> 00:09:26,081
to minimize and let's say I initialize my
algorithm [inaudible] algorithm you know

104
00:09:26,081 --> 00:09:32,008
out there at that magenta point. If I take
one step of gradient descent you know, may

105
00:09:32,008 --> 00:09:36,094
be I'll take me to that point cuz my
derivatives pretty steep out there right.

106
00:09:36,094 --> 00:09:42,005
Now I'm at this green point and if I take
another step at [inaudible] descent you

107
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:47,003
notice that my derivative meaning the
slope is less steep at the green point in

108
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:51,095
compared to at the [inaudible] point out
there right. Because as I approach the

109
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:56,088
minimum my derivative gets closer and
closer to zero as I approach the minimum.

110
00:09:56,088 --> 00:10:01,079
So. After one step of grade and descent,
my new derivative is a little bit smaller.

111
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:06,063
So I wanna take another step of grade and
descent. I will naturally take a somewhat

112
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:11,059
smaller step from this green point than I
did from the magenta point. Now by the new

113
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:16,003
point, the red point, and then now even
closer to global minimums, so the

114
00:10:16,003 --> 00:10:21,022
derivative here will be even smaller than
it was at the green point. So when I take

115
00:10:21,022 --> 00:10:26,041
another step of [inaudible], you know, now
my derivative term is even smaller, and so

116
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:31,036
the magnitude of the update to theta
[inaudible] is even smaller, since you can

117
00:10:31,036 --> 00:10:39,014
small step like so, and as greater descend
runs. You will automatically take smaller

118
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:46,034
and smaller steps until eventually you are
taking very small steps, you know, and you

119
00:10:46,034 --> 00:10:52,073
find the converge to the to the local
minimum. So, just to recap. In gradient

120
00:10:52,073 --> 00:10:57,071
descent as we approach the local minimum,
grading descent will automatically take

121
00:10:57,071 --> 00:11:02,063
smaller steps and that's because as we
approach the local minimum, by definition

122
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:07,012
of local minimum is when you have this
derivative equal to zero. So as we

123
00:11:07,012 --> 00:11:12,040
approach the local minimum this derivative
theorem will automatically get smaller and

124
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,095
so gradient descent will automatically
take small step. So, this is what

125
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:21,050
[inaudible] looks like, and so actually
there is no need to decrease alpha

126
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:26,025
overtime. So, that's the grade and descent
algorithm, and you can use it to minimize,

127
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:30,071
to try to minimize any cause function J.
Not the cause function J to be defined for

128
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:34,073
linear regression. In the next video,
we're going to take the function J, and

129
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:38,054
set that back to be exactly linear
regression's cause function. The, the

130
00:11:38,054 --> 00:11:43,005
square cause function that we came up with
earlier. And taking grade and descent, and

131
00:11:43,005 --> 00:11:47,035
the square cause function, and putting
them together. That will give us our first

132
00:11:47,035 --> 00:11:50,094
learning algorithm, that'll give us our
linear regression algorithm.
