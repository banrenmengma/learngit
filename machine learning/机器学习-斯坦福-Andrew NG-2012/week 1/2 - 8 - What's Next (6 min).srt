1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,083
You now know about linear regression
and gradient descent. The plan from here

2
00:00:04,083 --> 00:00:09,043
on out is to tell you about a couple of
important extensions of these ideas.

3
00:00:09,043 --> 00:00:13,066
Concretely here they are. First it turns
out that in order to solve this

4
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:18,046
minimization problem, turns out there's an
algorithm for solving for theta zero and

5
00:00:18,046 --> 00:00:22,097
theta one exactly without needing an
iterative algorithm. Without needing this

6
00:00:22,097 --> 00:00:27,055
algorithm like gradient descent that we
had to iterate, you know, multiple times

7
00:00:27,055 --> 00:00:32,028
over. So it turns out there are advantages
and disadvantages of this algorithm that

8
00:00:32,028 --> 00:00:36,089
lets you just solve for theta zero and
theta one, basically in just one shot. One

9
00:00:36,089 --> 00:00:41,068
advantage is that there is no longer a
learning rate alpha that you need to worry

10
00:00:41,068 --> 00:00:46,041
about and set. And so it can be much
faster for some problems. We'll talk about

11
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:51,005
its advantages and disadvantages later.
Second, we'll also talk about algorithms

12
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:55,042
for learning with a larger number of
features. So, so far we've been learning

13
00:00:55,042 --> 00:01:00,002
with just one feature, the size of the
house and using that to predict the price,

14
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:04,068
so we're trying to take x and use that to
predict y. But for other learning problems

15
00:01:04,068 --> 00:01:09,089
we may have a larger number of features.
So for example let's say that you know not

16
00:01:09,089 --> 00:01:15,044
only the size, but also the number of
bedrooms, the number of floors, and the age

17
00:01:15,044 --> 00:01:20,093
of these houses. And you want
to use that to predict the price of the

18
00:01:20,093 --> 00:01:26,000
houses. In that case maybe we'll call
these features x1, x2, x3, and x4. So now

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,055
we have, you know, four features. We want to
use these four features to predict why the

20
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:36,079
price of the house. It turns out with all
of these features, four of them in this

21
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,085
case, it turns out that with multiple
features it becomes harder to

22
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:47,024
plot or visualize the data. So for example
here we try to plot this type of data

23
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:52,082
set. Maybe we will have the vertical axis
be the price and maybe we can have one

24
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:58,007
axis here, and another one here where this
axis is the size of the house, and that

25
00:01:58,007 --> 00:02:02,082
axis is the number of bedrooms. You know,
but this is just plotting, right my first

26
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:07,041
two features: size and number of bedrooms.
And when we have these additional features

27
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:11,067
I don't know, I just don't know how to
plot all of these data, right cuz I need

28
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:15,088
like a 4-dimensional or 5-dimensional
figure. I don't really know how to plot

29
00:02:15,088 --> 00:02:19,093
you know something more than like a
3-dimensional figure, like, like what I

30
00:02:19,093 --> 00:02:24,013
have over here. Also as you can tell, the
notation starts to get a little more

31
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:28,023
complicated, right. So rather than just
having x our features we now have x1

32
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:33,051
through x4. And we're using these
subscripts to denote my four different

33
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:38,005
features. It turns out the best notation
to keep all of this straight and to

34
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:42,082
understand what's going on with the data
even when we don't quite know how to plot

35
00:02:42,082 --> 00:02:47,042
it. It turns out that the best notation is
the notation of linear algebra. Linear

36
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:52,019
algebra gives us a notation and a set of
things or a set of operations that we can

37
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:58,023
do with matrices and vectors. For example.
Here's a matrix where the columns of this

38
00:02:58,023 --> 00:03:03,037
matrix are: The first column is the sizes
of the four houses, the second column was

39
00:03:03,037 --> 00:03:08,002
the number of bedrooms, that's the number
of floors and that was the age of the

40
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:12,049
home. And so a matrix is a block of
numbers that lets me take all of my data,

41
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:17,088
all of my x's. All of my features and
organize them efficiently into sort of one

42
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:23,056
big block of numbers like that. And here
is what we call a vector in linear algebra

43
00:03:23,056 --> 00:03:29,011
where the four numbers here are the prices
of the four houses that we saw on the

44
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:34,033
previous slide. So. In the next set of
videos what I'm going to do is do a quick

45
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:38,072
review of linear algebra. If you haven't
seen matrices and vectors before, so if

46
00:03:38,072 --> 00:03:43,029
all of this, everything on this slide is
brand new to you or if you've seen linear

47
00:03:43,029 --> 00:03:47,074
algebra before, but it's been a while so
you aren't completely familiar with it

48
00:03:47,074 --> 00:03:52,041
anymore, then please watch the next set of
videos. And I'll quickly review the linear

49
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:57,009
algebra you need in order to implement and
use the more powerful versions of linear

50
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:01,048
regression. It turns out linear algebra
isn't just useful for linear regression

51
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:05,097
models but these ideas of matrices and
vectors will be useful for helping us

52
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:10,027
to implement and actually get
computationally efficient implementations

53
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:15,008
for many later machines learning models as
well. And as you can tell these sorts of

54
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:19,061
matrices and vectors will give us an
efficient way to start to organize large

55
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:23,091
amounts of data, when we work with larger
training sets. So, in case, in case

56
00:04:23,091 --> 00:04:28,061
you're not familiar with linear algebra or
in case linear algebra seems like a

57
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:33,026
complicated, scary concept for those of you who've
never seen it before, don't worry about

58
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:37,079
it. It turns out in order to implement
machine learning algorithms we need only

59
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:42,000
the very, very basics of
linear algebra and you'll be able to very

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,083
quickly pick up everything you need to
know in the next few videos.

61
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:53,038
Concretely, to decide if you should
watch the next set of videos, here are the

62
00:04:53,038 --> 00:04:57,080
topics I'm going to cover. Talk about
what are matrices and vectors. Talk about how

63
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:02,022
to add, subtract, multiply matrices and vectors.
Talk about the ideas of matrix inverses

64
00:05:02,022 --> 00:05:06,069
and transposes. And so, if you are not
sure if you should watch the next set of

65
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:11,039
videos take a look at these two things. So
if you think you know how to compute this

66
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,064
quantity, this matrix transpose times
another matrix. If you think you know, if

67
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:20,017
you have seen this stuff before, if you
know how to compute the inverse of matrix

68
00:05:20,017 --> 00:05:24,042
times a vector, minus a number, times
another vector. If these two things look

69
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:29,030
completely familiar to you then you can
safely skip the optional set of videos on

70
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:34,060
linear algebra. But if these, concepts, if you're
slightly uncertain what these blocks of

71
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,090
numbers or these matrices of numbers mean,
then please take a look of the next set of

72
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,014
videos and, it'll very quickly teach you what
you need to know about linear algebra in

73
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:49,093
order to program machine learning
algorithms and deal with large amounts of data.
