1
00:00:00,013 --> 00:00:01,013
In the last video, we talked

2
00:00:01,047 --> 00:00:03,037
about dimensionality reduction for

3
00:00:03,052 --> 00:00:05,008
the purpose of compressing the data.

4
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:06,076
In this video, I'd like

5
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:08,014
to tell you about a second application

6
00:00:08,086 --> 00:00:12,049
of dimensionality reduction and that is to visualize the data.

7
00:00:13,043 --> 00:00:14,021
For a lot of machine learning

8
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,089
applications, it really helps

9
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:17,064
us to develop effective learning

10
00:00:17,098 --> 00:00:20,026
algorithms, if we can understand our data better.

11
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,089
If there is some way of visualizing

12
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,078
the data better, and so,

13
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:25,080
dimensionality reduction offers us,

14
00:00:25,098 --> 00:00:27,087
often, another useful tool to do so.

15
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,028
Let's start with an example.

16
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:31,037
Let's say we've collected a large

17
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:33,018
data set of many statistics

18
00:00:33,084 --> 00:00:35,072
and facts about different countries around the world.

19
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:37,018
So, maybe the first feature, X1

20
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:39,053
is the country's GDP, or the

21
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:41,071
Gross Domestic Product, and

22
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:43,021
X2 is a per capita, meaning

23
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,077
the per person GDP, X3

24
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:48,034
human development index, life

25
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:51,028
expectancy, X5, X6 and so on.

26
00:00:51,056 --> 00:00:52,067
And we may have a huge data set

27
00:00:52,088 --> 00:00:54,007
like this, where, you know,

28
00:00:54,028 --> 00:00:56,089
maybe 50 features for

29
00:00:57,064 --> 00:00:59,065
every country, and we have a huge set of countries.

30
00:01:01,031 --> 00:01:02,029
So is there something

31
00:01:02,081 --> 00:01:05,020
we can do to try to understand our data better?

32
00:01:05,048 --> 00:01:07,020
I've given this huge table of numbers.

33
00:01:07,084 --> 00:01:11,001
How do you visualize this data?

34
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:12,042
If you have 50 features, it's

35
00:01:12,059 --> 00:01:13,096
very difficult to plot 50-dimensional

36
00:01:15,062 --> 00:01:15,062
data.

37
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:19,006
What is a good way to examine this data?

38
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:22,081
Using dimensionality reduction, what

39
00:01:22,095 --> 00:01:24,092
we can do is, instead of

40
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,023
having each country represented by

41
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:30,021
this featured vector, xi, which

42
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:33,014
is 50-dimensional, so instead

43
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,079
of, say, having a country

44
00:01:35,032 --> 00:01:37,026
like Canada, instead of

45
00:01:37,037 --> 00:01:38,087
having 50 numbers to represent the features

46
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:41,003
of Canada, let's say we

47
00:01:41,023 --> 00:01:42,034
can come up with a different feature

48
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,093
representation that is these

49
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:47,065
z vectors, that is in R2.

50
00:01:49,059 --> 00:01:50,078
If that's the case, if we

51
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,093
can have just a pair of

52
00:01:52,023 --> 00:01:53,064
numbers, z1 and z2 that

53
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,050
somehow, summarizes my 50

54
00:01:55,064 --> 00:01:56,073
numbers, maybe what we

55
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:57,087
can do  [xx] is to plot

56
00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:59,075
these countries in R2 and

57
00:01:59,096 --> 00:02:01,050
use that to try to

58
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:03,081
understand the space in

59
00:02:03,095 --> 00:02:05,062
[xx] of features of different

60
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:08,025
countries [xx]  the better and

61
00:02:08,052 --> 00:02:10,068
so, here, what you

62
00:02:10,078 --> 00:02:11,097
can do is reduce the

63
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,062
data from 50

64
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:16,058
D, from 50 dimensions

65
00:02:17,046 --> 00:02:18,037
to 2D, so you can

66
00:02:18,074 --> 00:02:19,096
plot this as a 2

67
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:21,046
dimensional plot, and, when

68
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:23,006
you do that, it turns out

69
00:02:23,027 --> 00:02:24,011
that, if you look at the

70
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:25,077
output of the Dimensionality Reduction algorithms,

71
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:28,065
It usually doesn't astride a

72
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:32,034
physical meaning to these new features you want [xx] to.

73
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:35,021
It's often up to us to figure out you know, roughly what these features means.

74
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:39,043
But, And if you plot those features, here is what you might find.

75
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,009
So, here, every country

76
00:02:41,075 --> 00:02:43,006
is represented by a point

77
00:02:43,081 --> 00:02:44,063
ZI, which is an R2

78
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,043
and so each of those.

79
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:47,078
Dots, and this figure

80
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:48,097
represents a country, and so,

81
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:50,083
here's Z1 and here's

82
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:53,037
Z2, and [xx] [xx] of these.

83
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:55,031
So, you might find,

84
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:57,027
for example, That the horizontial

85
00:02:57,068 --> 00:02:59,024
axis the Z1 axis

86
00:03:00,027 --> 00:03:01,097
corresponds roughly to the

87
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:05,015
overall country size, or

88
00:03:05,022 --> 00:03:07,040
the overall economic activity of a country.

89
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,094
So the overall GDP, overall

90
00:03:10,075 --> 00:03:13,049
economic size of a country.

91
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:15,086
Whereas the vertical axis in our

92
00:03:15,091 --> 00:03:18,025
data might correspond to the

93
00:03:18,038 --> 00:03:21,043
per person GDP.

94
00:03:22,028 --> 00:03:23,090
Or the per person well being,

95
00:03:24,015 --> 00:03:30,072
or the per person economic activity, and,

96
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,037
you might find that, given these

97
00:03:32,056 --> 00:03:33,053
50 features, you know, these

98
00:03:34,003 --> 00:03:35,015
are really the 2 main dimensions

99
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,075
of the deviation, and so, out

100
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:39,013
here you may have a country

101
00:03:39,081 --> 00:03:41,021
like the U.S.A., which

102
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,037
is a relatively large GDP,

103
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:44,099
you know, is a very

104
00:03:45,027 --> 00:03:46,049
large GDP and a relatively

105
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:48,075
high per-person GDP as well.

106
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:50,071
Whereas here you might have

107
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,071
a country like Singapore, which

108
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:55,003
actually has a very

109
00:03:55,038 --> 00:03:56,075
high per person GDP as well,

110
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,000
but because Singapore is a much

111
00:03:58,009 --> 00:03:59,081
smaller country the overall

112
00:04:01,003 --> 00:04:02,022
economy size of Singapore

113
00:04:03,046 --> 00:04:05,006
is much smaller than the US.

114
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:08,013
And, over here, you would

115
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:10,087
have countries where individuals

116
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,031
are unfortunately some are less

117
00:04:13,043 --> 00:04:14,065
well off, maybe shorter life expectancy,

118
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:17,000
less health care, less economic

119
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,037
maturity that's why smaller

120
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:21,094
countries, whereas a point

121
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:23,077
like this will correspond to

122
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:26,000
a country that has a

123
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,087
fair, has a substantial amount of

124
00:04:28,008 --> 00:04:29,054
economic activity, but where individuals

125
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:32,051
tend to be somewhat less well off.

126
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,069
So you might find that

127
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,061
the axes Z1 and Z2

128
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:37,013
can help you to most succinctly

129
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:39,000
capture really what are the

130
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,012
two main dimensions of the variations

131
00:04:41,036 --> 00:04:42,012
amongst different countries.

132
00:04:43,043 --> 00:04:44,091
Such as the overall economic

133
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:46,085
activity of the country projected

134
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:48,080
by the size of the

135
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:50,076
country's overall economy as well

136
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:53,043
as the per-person individual

137
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:55,029
well-being, measured by per-person

138
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,047
GDP, per-person healthcare, and things like that.

139
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:02,012
So that's how you can

140
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:04,041
use dimensionality reduction, in

141
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,023
order to reduce data from

142
00:05:06,047 --> 00:05:07,086
50 dimensions or whatever, down

143
00:05:08,014 --> 00:05:09,051
to two dimensions, or maybe

144
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:11,026
down to three dimensions, so that

145
00:05:11,037 --> 00:05:13,074
you can plot it and understand your data better.

146
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,000
In the next video, we'll start

147
00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:17,057
to develop a specific algorithm,

148
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:19,050
called PCA, or Principal Component

149
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,036
Analysis, which will allow

150
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:22,062
us to do this and also

151
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:26,068
do the earlier application I talked about of compressing the data.
