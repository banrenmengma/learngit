1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,022
In the clustering problem we are

2
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,062
given an unlabeled data

3
00:00:03,095 --> 00:00:05,004
set and we would like

4
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,048
to have an algorithm automatically

5
00:00:07,032 --> 00:00:08,069
group the data into coherent

6
00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:11,000
subsets or into coherent clusters for us.

7
00:00:12,038 --> 00:00:14,016
The K Means algorithm is by

8
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:15,085
far the most popular, by

9
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:17,041
far the most widely used clustering

10
00:00:17,078 --> 00:00:19,037
algorithm, and in this

11
00:00:19,055 --> 00:00:20,032
video I would like to tell

12
00:00:20,057 --> 00:00:23,039
you what the K Means Algorithm is and how it works.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,030
The K means clustering algorithm is best illustrated in pictures.

14
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,076
Let's say I want to take

15
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:32,032
an unlabeled data set like

16
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:34,003
the one shown here, and I

17
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,045
want to group the data into two clusters.

18
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:38,074
If I run the K Means clustering

19
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:41,056
algorithm, here is what

20
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,018
I'm going to do. The first step is to randomly initialize two

21
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,092
points, called the cluster centroids.

22
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,017
So, these two crosses here,

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,072
these are called the Cluster Centroids

24
00:00:53,027 --> 00:00:54,032
and I have two of them

25
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:57,084
because I want to group my data into two clusters.

26
00:00:59,013 --> 00:01:02,039
K Means is an iterative algorithm and it does two things.

27
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:04,079
First is a cluster assignment

28
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:07,079
step, and second is a move centroid step.

29
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:09,062
So, let me tell you what those things mean.

30
00:01:11,017 --> 00:01:12,051
The first of the two steps in the

31
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,093
loop of K means, is this cluster assignment step.

32
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:17,006
What that means is that, it's

33
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:18,035
going through each of the

34
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,087
examples, each of these green

35
00:01:20,017 --> 00:01:22,012
dots shown here and depending

36
00:01:22,057 --> 00:01:24,014
on whether it's closer to the

37
00:01:24,034 --> 00:01:25,053
red cluster centroid or the

38
00:01:25,062 --> 00:01:27,039
blue cluster centroid, it is going

39
00:01:27,056 --> 00:01:28,056
to assign each of the

40
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:30,067
data points to one of the two cluster centroids.

41
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:33,034
Specifically, what I mean

42
00:01:33,045 --> 00:01:34,060
by that, is to go through your

43
00:01:34,073 --> 00:01:36,093
data set and color each

44
00:01:37,012 --> 00:01:38,051
of the points either red or

45
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:39,089
blue, depending on whether

46
00:01:40,015 --> 00:01:41,006
it is closer to the red

47
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,015
cluster centroid or the blue

48
00:01:42,046 --> 00:01:45,020
cluster centroid, and I've done that in this diagram here.

49
00:01:46,093 --> 00:01:48,070
So, that was the cluster assignment step.

50
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:52,026
The other part of K means, in the

51
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,039
loop of K means, is the move

52
00:01:53,059 --> 00:01:54,085
centroid step, and what

53
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:55,073
we are going to do is, we

54
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,089
are going to take the two cluster centroids,

55
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,054
that is, the red cross and

56
00:01:58,082 --> 00:02:00,026
the blue cross, and we are

57
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:01,042
going to move them to the average

58
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:03,090
of the points colored the same colour.

59
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:05,070
So what we are going

60
00:02:05,073 --> 00:02:06,051
to do is look at all the

61
00:02:06,062 --> 00:02:07,081
red points and compute the

62
00:02:08,024 --> 00:02:09,052
average, really the mean

63
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:11,050
of the location of all the red points,

64
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:13,068
and we are going to move the red cluster centroid there.

65
00:02:14,018 --> 00:02:15,025
And the same things for the

66
00:02:15,046 --> 00:02:16,037
blue cluster centroid, look at all

67
00:02:16,056 --> 00:02:17,071
the blue dots and compute their

68
00:02:17,084 --> 00:02:19,071
mean, and then move the blue cluster centroid there.

69
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:20,087
So, let me do that now.

70
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,099
We're going to move the cluster centroids as follows

71
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:27,034
and I've now moved them to their new means.

72
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,075
The red one moved like that

73
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:31,034
and the blue one moved

74
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,046
like that and the red one moved like that.

75
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:35,046
And then we go back to another cluster

76
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,091
assignment step, so we're again

77
00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:38,009
going to look at all of

78
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:39,066
my unlabeled examples and depending

79
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:42,084
on whether it's closer the red or the blue cluster centroid,

80
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:45,015
I'm going to color them either red or blue.

81
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:47,015
I'm going to assign each point

82
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:48,055
to one of the two cluster centroids, so let me do that now.

83
00:02:51,044 --> 00:02:52,025
And so the colors of some of the points just changed.

84
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,068
And then I'm going to do another move centroid step.

85
00:02:56,003 --> 00:02:56,081
So I'm going to compute the

86
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:57,087
average of all the blue points,

87
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,000
compute the average of all

88
00:02:59,003 --> 00:03:00,036
the red points and move my

89
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:03,077
cluster centroids like this, and

90
00:03:03,093 --> 00:03:05,065
so, let's do that again.

91
00:03:06,015 --> 00:03:07,081
Let me do one more cluster assignment step.

92
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:09,044
So colour each point red

93
00:03:09,062 --> 00:03:10,084
or blue, based on what it's

94
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:13,006
closer to and then

95
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:20,000
do another move centroid step and we're done.

96
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:21,022
And in fact if you

97
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:23,025
keep running additional iterations of

98
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,002
K means from here the

99
00:03:26,015 --> 00:03:27,024
cluster centroids will not change

100
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:28,077
any further and the colours of

101
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,075
the points will not change any

102
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:31,052
further. And so, this is

103
00:03:31,081 --> 00:03:33,052
the, at this point,

104
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:35,028
K means has converged and it's

105
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,043
done a pretty good job finding

106
00:03:37,046 --> 00:03:38,075
the two clusters in this data.

107
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:40,031
Let's write out the K means algorithm more formally.

108
00:03:42,015 --> 00:03:43,093
The K means algorithm takes two inputs.

109
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:46,019
One is a parameter K,

110
00:03:46,044 --> 00:03:47,025
which is the number of clusters

111
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,090
you want to find in the data.

112
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,081
I'll later say how we might

113
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:53,028
go about trying to choose k, but

114
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:54,059
for now let's just say that

115
00:03:55,011 --> 00:03:56,021
we've decided we want a

116
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,059
certain number of clusters and we're

117
00:03:57,068 --> 00:03:58,081
going to tell the algorithm how many

118
00:03:59,003 --> 00:04:00,072
clusters we think there are in the data set.

119
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:02,012
And then K means also

120
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:03,043
takes as input this sort

121
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:05,006
of unlabeled training set of

122
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:06,053
just the Xs and

123
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:08,043
because this is unsupervised learning, we

124
00:04:08,052 --> 00:04:10,068
don't have the labels Y anymore.

125
00:04:10,097 --> 00:04:12,046
And for unsupervised learning of

126
00:04:12,074 --> 00:04:14,002
the K means I'm going to

127
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:16,016
use the convention that XI

128
00:04:16,042 --> 00:04:17,075
is an RN dimensional vector.

129
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:19,018
And that's why my training examples

130
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:22,045
are now N dimensional rather N plus one dimensional vectors.

131
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:25,043
This is what the K means algorithm does.

132
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:28,062
The first step is that it

133
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,017
randomly initializes k cluster

134
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:33,055
centroids which we will

135
00:04:33,081 --> 00:04:34,061
call mu 1, mu 2, up

136
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:36,025
to mu k. And so

137
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:38,044
in the earlier diagram, the

138
00:04:38,055 --> 00:04:40,076
cluster centroids corresponded to the

139
00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:42,024
location of the red cross

140
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:44,001
and the location of the blue cross.

141
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,063
So there we had two cluster

142
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:47,000
centroids, so maybe the red

143
00:04:47,017 --> 00:04:48,047
cross was mu 1

144
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:49,093
and the blue cross was mu

145
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,036
2, and more generally we would have

146
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:53,082
k cluster centroids rather than just 2.

147
00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:56,024
Then the inner loop

148
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:57,036
of k means does the following,

149
00:04:57,082 --> 00:04:59,001
we're going to repeatedly do the following.

150
00:05:00,006 --> 00:05:01,094
First for each of

151
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:03,092
my training examples, I'm going

152
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:05,094
to set this variable CI

153
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,095
to be the index 1 through

154
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:10,051
K of the cluster centroid closest to XI.

155
00:05:11,017 --> 00:05:13,081
So this was my cluster assignment

156
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:16,087
step, where we

157
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,068
took each of my examples and

158
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:20,074
coloured it either red

159
00:05:21,005 --> 00:05:22,005
or blue, depending on which

160
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:23,093
cluster centroid it was closest to.

161
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:25,008
So CI is going to be

162
00:05:25,027 --> 00:05:26,027
a number from 1 to

163
00:05:26,037 --> 00:05:27,068
K that tells us, you

164
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,075
know, is it closer to the

165
00:05:28,092 --> 00:05:29,081
red cross or is it

166
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:31,017
closer to the blue cross,

167
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:33,020
and another way of writing this

168
00:05:33,057 --> 00:05:35,035
is I'm going to,

169
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:37,081
to compute Ci, I'm

170
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:39,012
going to take my Ith

171
00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:41,017
example Xi and and

172
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:42,067
I'm going to measure it's distance

173
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:44,086
to each of my cluster centroids,

174
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:46,068
this is mu and then

175
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:48,063
lower-case k, right, so

176
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:50,062
capital K is the total

177
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:51,089
number centroids and I'm going

178
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,016
to use lower case k here

179
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:55,013
to index into the different centroids.

180
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:58,047
But so, Ci is going to, I'm going

181
00:05:58,055 --> 00:06:00,011
to minimize over my values

182
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:01,093
of k and find the

183
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:03,064
value of K that minimizes this

184
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:04,075
distance between Xi and the

185
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,012
cluster centroid, and then,

186
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,099
you know, the

187
00:06:09,006 --> 00:06:10,035
value of k that minimizes

188
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:12,016
this, that's what gets set in

189
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,010
Ci. So, here's

190
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:16,047
another way of writing out what Ci is.

191
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:19,014
If I write the norm between

192
00:06:19,026 --> 00:06:21,050
Xi minus Mu-k,

193
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,012
then this is the distance between

194
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:26,004
my ith training example

195
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,035
Xi and the cluster centroid

196
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,027
Mu subscript K, this is--this

197
00:06:31,014 --> 00:06:32,082
here, that's a lowercase K. So uppercase

198
00:06:33,031 --> 00:06:34,070
K is going to be

199
00:06:34,098 --> 00:06:36,020
used to denote the total

200
00:06:36,044 --> 00:06:38,001
number of cluster centroids,

201
00:06:38,076 --> 00:06:40,043
and this lowercase K's

202
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,083
a number between one and

203
00:06:41,095 --> 00:06:42,093
capital K. I'm just using

204
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,044
lower case K to index

205
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:45,099
into my different cluster centroids.

206
00:06:47,012 --> 00:06:49,001
Next is lower case k. So

207
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:51,032
that's the distance between the example and the cluster centroid

208
00:06:51,049 --> 00:06:52,081
and so what I'm going to

209
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:54,032
do is find the value

210
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:56,038
of K, of lower case

211
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,089
k that minimizes this, and

212
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:00,031
so the value of

213
00:07:00,048 --> 00:07:02,010
k that minimizes you know,

214
00:07:02,027 --> 00:07:03,061
that's what I'm going to

215
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,056
set as Ci, and

216
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:07,085
by convention here I've written

217
00:07:08,018 --> 00:07:09,043
the distance between Xi and

218
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:11,031
the cluster centroid, by convention

219
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:13,032
people actually tend to write this as the squared distance.

220
00:07:13,077 --> 00:07:15,037
So we think of Ci as picking

221
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:16,086
the cluster centroid with the smallest

222
00:07:17,044 --> 00:07:20,011
squared distance to my training example Xi.

223
00:07:20,075 --> 00:07:22,007
But of course minimizing squared distance,

224
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,069
and minimizing distance that should

225
00:07:23,087 --> 00:07:25,067
give you the same value of Ci,

226
00:07:25,082 --> 00:07:26,067
but we usually put in the

227
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:28,012
square there, just as the

228
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:31,001
convention that people use for K means.

229
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,031
So that was the cluster assignment step.

230
00:07:33,048 --> 00:07:34,075
The other in the loop

231
00:07:34,098 --> 00:07:37,074
of K means does the move centroid step.

232
00:07:40,054 --> 00:07:41,075
And what that does is for

233
00:07:42,016 --> 00:07:43,045
each of my cluster centroids, so

234
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:44,074
for lower case k equals 1 through

235
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:46,018
K, it sets Mu-k equals

236
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,045
to the average of the points assigned to cluster.

237
00:07:49,026 --> 00:07:50,072
So as a concrete example, let's say

238
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:52,010
that one of my cluster

239
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:53,042
centroids, let's say cluster centroid

240
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:55,002
two, has training examples,

241
00:07:55,081 --> 00:08:02,038
you know, 1, 5, 6, and 10 assigned to it.

242
00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:04,026
And what this means is,

243
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:05,050
really this means that C1 equals

244
00:08:06,056 --> 00:08:09,018
to C5 equals to

245
00:08:10,068 --> 00:08:12,018
C6 equals to and

246
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,073
similarly well c10 equals, too, right?

247
00:08:14,097 --> 00:08:17,006
If we got that

248
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:18,093
from the cluster assignment step, then

249
00:08:19,018 --> 00:08:21,025
that means examples 1,5,6 and

250
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:22,095
10 were assigned to the cluster centroid two.

251
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:25,020
Then in this move centroid step,

252
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:26,057
what I'm going to do is just

253
00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:29,029
compute the average of these four things.

254
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:33,095
So X1 plus X5 plus X6

255
00:08:34,026 --> 00:08:35,062
plus X10.

256
00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:37,019
And now I'm going

257
00:08:37,037 --> 00:08:38,062
to average them so here I

258
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:40,001
have four points assigned to

259
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,070
this cluster centroid, just take

260
00:08:42,027 --> 00:08:43,024
one quarter of that.

261
00:08:43,098 --> 00:08:45,088
And now Mu2 is going to

262
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,090
be an n-dimensional vector.

263
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,048
Because each of these

264
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,004
example x1, x5, x6, x10

265
00:08:52,015 --> 00:08:53,016
each of them were an n-dimensional

266
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,014
vector, and I'm going to

267
00:08:55,024 --> 00:08:56,026
add up these things and, you

268
00:08:56,054 --> 00:08:57,087
know, divide by four because I

269
00:08:57,094 --> 00:08:59,032
have four points assigned to this

270
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:00,073
cluster centroid, I end up

271
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:02,076
with my move centroid step,

272
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:05,025
for my cluster centroid mu-2.

273
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,085
This has the effect of moving

274
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:08,095
mu-2 to the average of

275
00:09:09,012 --> 00:09:10,062
the four points listed here.

276
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:13,085
One thing that I've asked is, well here we said, let's

277
00:09:14,008 --> 00:09:16,060
let mu-k be the average of the points assigned to the cluster.

278
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,089
But what if there is

279
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:21,030
a cluster centroid no points

280
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:23,000
with zero points assigned to it.

281
00:09:23,027 --> 00:09:24,029
In that case the more common

282
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,072
thing to do is to just

283
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:27,022
eliminate that cluster centroid.

284
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,062
And if you do that, you end

285
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:30,025
up with K minus one clusters

286
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:33,084
instead of k clusters.

287
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,062
Sometimes if you really need

288
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:37,037
k clusters, then the other

289
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:38,022
thing you can do if you

290
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:39,052
have a cluster centroid with no

291
00:09:39,074 --> 00:09:41,016
points assigned to it is you can

292
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:42,059
just randomly reinitialize that cluster

293
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:44,087
centroid, but it's more

294
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:46,059
common to just eliminate a

295
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:48,021
cluster if somewhere during

296
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,069
K means it with no points

297
00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:52,001
assigned to that cluster centroid, and

298
00:09:52,013 --> 00:09:53,034
that can happen, altthough in practice

299
00:09:53,082 --> 00:09:55,059
it happens not that often.

300
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,027
So that's the K means Algorithm.

301
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,022
Before wrapping up this video

302
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:01,028
I just want to tell you

303
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:02,071
about one other common application

304
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,067
of K Means and that's

305
00:10:04,091 --> 00:10:06,084
to the problems with non well separated clusters.

306
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:08,063
Here's what I mean.

307
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:10,032
So far we've been picturing K Means

308
00:10:10,095 --> 00:10:12,009
and applying it to data

309
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:13,051
sets like that shown here where

310
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,059
we have three pretty

311
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:17,037
well separated clusters, and we'd

312
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:19,092
like an algorithm to find maybe the 3 clusters for us.

313
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:21,084
But it turns out that

314
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:23,017
very often K Means is also

315
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,086
applied to data sets that

316
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:26,024
look like this where there may

317
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:28,029
not be several very

318
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:30,025
well separated clusters.

319
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,096
Here is an example application, to t-shirt sizing.

320
00:10:34,007 --> 00:10:34,064
Let's say you are a t-shirt

321
00:10:35,026 --> 00:10:37,036
manufacturer you've done is you've gone

322
00:10:38,002 --> 00:10:39,030
to the population that you

323
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:40,051
want to sell t-shirts to, and

324
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,019
you've collected a number of

325
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,076
examples of the height and weight

326
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:45,035
of these people in your

327
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:46,074
population and so, well I

328
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,027
guess height and weight tend to

329
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:50,030
be positively highlighted so maybe

330
00:10:50,053 --> 00:10:51,015
you end up with a data

331
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:52,059
set like this, you know, with

332
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,090
a sample or set of

333
00:10:53,098 --> 00:10:56,000
examples of different peoples heights and weight.

334
00:10:56,052 --> 00:10:57,087
Let's say you want to size your t shirts.

335
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,080
Let's say I want to design

336
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:01,048
and sell t shirts of three

337
00:11:01,065 --> 00:11:03,097
sizes, small, medium and large.

338
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:06,041
So how big should I make my small one?

339
00:11:06,054 --> 00:11:07,032
How big should I my medium?

340
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:09,029
And how big should I make my large t-shirts.

341
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,028
One way to do that would

342
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,004
to be to run my k means

343
00:11:12,026 --> 00:11:13,057
clustering logarithm on this data

344
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,063
set that I have shown on

345
00:11:14,082 --> 00:11:16,057
the right and maybe what

346
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:18,026
K Means will do is group

347
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,046
all of these points into one

348
00:11:20,065 --> 00:11:22,012
cluster and group all

349
00:11:22,034 --> 00:11:24,014
of these points into a

350
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:25,052
second cluster and group

351
00:11:25,074 --> 00:11:28,008
all of those points into a third cluster.

352
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:29,087
So, even though the data, you

353
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:30,096
know, before hand it didn't

354
00:11:31,005 --> 00:11:31,099
seem like we had 3

355
00:11:32,004 --> 00:11:33,091
well separated clusters, K Means will

356
00:11:34,004 --> 00:11:36,087
kind of separate out the data

357
00:11:37,032 --> 00:11:38,055
into multiple pluses for you.

358
00:11:39,026 --> 00:11:40,022
And what you can do is then

359
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,000
look at this first population of

360
00:11:42,012 --> 00:11:44,034
people and look at

361
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,059
them and, you know, look

362
00:11:45,077 --> 00:11:46,080
at the height and weight, and

363
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:47,089
try to design a small

364
00:11:48,035 --> 00:11:49,053
t-shirt so that it kind

365
00:11:49,071 --> 00:11:51,015
of fits this first population of

366
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,083
people well and then design

367
00:11:53,014 --> 00:11:55,079
a medium t-shirt and design a large t-shirt.

368
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,086
And this is in fact kind of

369
00:11:57,099 --> 00:11:59,074
an example of market segmentation

370
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,079
where you're using K Means to separate your

371
00:12:02,094 --> 00:12:04,032
market into 3 different segments.

372
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:06,050
So you can design a product

373
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,025
separately that is a small, medium, and large t-shirts,

374
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,023
that tries to suit

375
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,076
the needs of each of your

376
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:15,030
3 separate sub-populations well.

377
00:12:16,022 --> 00:12:17,057
So that's the K Means algorithm.

378
00:12:18,024 --> 00:12:19,008
And by now you should

379
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,050
know how to implement the K

380
00:12:20,062 --> 00:12:22,050
Means Algorithm and kind of get it to work for some problems.

381
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,037
But in the next few videos

382
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:26,042
what I want to do is

383
00:12:26,058 --> 00:12:27,069
really get more deeply into the nuts

384
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,021
and bolts of K means and

385
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,008
to talk a bit about how to actually get this to work really well.
