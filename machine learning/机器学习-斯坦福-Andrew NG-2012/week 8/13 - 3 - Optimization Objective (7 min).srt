1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:01,054
Most of the supervised learning algorithms

2
00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:02,089
we've seen, things like linear

3
00:00:03,012 --> 00:00:04,073
regression, logistic regression and

4
00:00:04,092 --> 00:00:05,084
so on. All of those

5
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:08,008
algorithms have an optimization objective

6
00:00:08,067 --> 00:00:10,092
or some cost function that the algorithm was trying to minimize.

7
00:00:11,092 --> 00:00:13,017
It turns out that K-means also

8
00:00:13,076 --> 00:00:15,073
has an optimization objective or

9
00:00:15,086 --> 00:00:18,071
a cost function that is trying to minimize.

10
00:00:19,062 --> 00:00:20,017
And in this video, I'd like to tell

11
00:00:20,023 --> 00:00:23,062
you what that optimization objective is.

12
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:24,042
And the reason I want to do so

13
00:00:24,075 --> 00:00:26,096
is because this will be useful to us for two purposes.

14
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:29,032
First, knowing what is the

15
00:00:29,048 --> 00:00:30,089
optimization objective of K-means

16
00:00:31,014 --> 00:00:32,039
will help us to

17
00:00:32,068 --> 00:00:33,096
debug the learning algorithm and

18
00:00:34,007 --> 00:00:35,007
just make sure that K-means is

19
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:37,010
running correctly, and second,

20
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,028
and perhaps even more importantly, in

21
00:00:39,053 --> 00:00:41,028
a later video we'll talk

22
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:42,057
about how we can use this to

23
00:00:42,072 --> 00:00:44,000
help K-means find better clusters

24
00:00:44,007 --> 00:00:46,028
and avoid local optima, but we'll do that in a later video that follows this one.

25
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,032
Just as a quick reminder, while K-means is

26
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:52,086
running we're going to be

27
00:00:54,045 --> 00:00:55,082
keeping track of two sets of variables.

28
00:00:56,042 --> 00:00:58,039
First is the CI's and

29
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,082
that keeps track of the

30
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,060
index or the number of the cluster

31
00:01:02,072 --> 00:01:05,004
to which an example x(i) is currently assigned.

32
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:05,095
And then, the other set of variables

33
00:01:06,054 --> 00:01:07,057
we use as Mu subscript

34
00:01:08,012 --> 00:01:09,040
K, which is the location

35
00:01:10,014 --> 00:01:12,010
of cluster centroid K. And,

36
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:13,075
again, for K-means

37
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:17,023
we use capital K to denote the total number of clusters.

38
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:19,031
And here lower case K,

39
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:20,090
you know, is going to be an

40
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:22,065
index into the cluster

41
00:01:22,096 --> 00:01:23,093
centroids, and so lower

42
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:24,093
case k is going to be

43
00:01:25,014 --> 00:01:26,039
a number between 1 and

44
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:29,062
capital K. Now, here's

45
00:01:29,084 --> 00:01:31,004
one more bit of notation which

46
00:01:31,026 --> 00:01:32,028
is going to use Mu

47
00:01:32,062 --> 00:01:34,056
subscript c(i) to denote

48
00:01:34,096 --> 00:01:36,065
the cluster centroid of the

49
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:38,040
cluster to which example x(i)

50
00:01:38,087 --> 00:01:40,050
has been assigned and

51
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,003
to explain that notation

52
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:43,045
a little bit more, let's

53
00:01:43,065 --> 00:01:45,059
say that x(i) has been

54
00:01:45,073 --> 00:01:47,076
assigned to cluster number five.

55
00:01:48,087 --> 00:01:49,082
What that means is that c(i),

56
00:01:50,084 --> 00:01:52,029
that is the index of x(i),

57
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,029
that that is equal to 5.

58
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:57,064
Right? Because you know, having c(i) equals 5,

59
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,026
that's what it means for the

60
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,071
example x(i) to be

61
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,043
assigned to cluster number 5.

62
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:05,070
And so Mu subscript

63
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:07,095
c(i) is going to

64
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,062
be equal to Mu subscript

65
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:12,025
5 because c(i) is equal

66
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:14,009
to 5.

67
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,056
This Mu substitute c(i) is the

68
00:02:16,065 --> 00:02:18,041
cluster centroid of cluster number

69
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:19,066
5, which is the cluster

70
00:02:20,012 --> 00:02:22,047
to which my example x(i) has been assigned.

71
00:02:23,046 --> 00:02:24,072
With this notation, we're now

72
00:02:24,096 --> 00:02:26,003
ready to write out what

73
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:28,015
is the optimization objective of

74
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:30,036
the K Mu clustering algorithm.

75
00:02:30,075 --> 00:02:30,080
And here it is.

76
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:32,093
The cost function that K-means

77
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:34,037
is minimizing is the

78
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:35,077
function J of all of

79
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:37,046
these parameters c1 through

80
00:02:37,088 --> 00:02:39,061
cM, Mu1 through MuK, that

81
00:02:39,078 --> 00:02:41,056
K-means is varying as the algorithm runs.

82
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:43,093
And the optimization objective is shown

83
00:02:44,015 --> 00:02:45,052
on the right, is the average of

84
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:46,043
one over M of the sum

85
00:02:46,062 --> 00:02:48,072
of i equals one through M of this term here

86
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,066
that I've just drawn the red box around.

87
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:54,068
The squared distance between

88
00:02:55,015 --> 00:02:57,053
each example x(i) and the

89
00:02:57,068 --> 00:02:58,074
location of the cluster

90
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,021
centroid to which x(i)

91
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:01,091
has been assigned.

92
00:03:03,024 --> 00:03:06,006
So let me just draw this in, let me explain this.

93
00:03:06,024 --> 00:03:07,080
Here is the location of training

94
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:09,078
example x(i), and here's the location

95
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,075
of the cluster centroid to which

96
00:03:11,096 --> 00:03:13,065
example x(i) has been assigned.

97
00:03:14,056 --> 00:03:17,008
So to explain this in pictures, if here is X1, X2.

98
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,053
And if a point

99
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:21,021
here, is my example

100
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:23,006
x(i), so if that

101
00:03:23,011 --> 00:03:24,084
is equal to my example x(i),

102
00:03:25,086 --> 00:03:27,000
and if x(i) has been assigned

103
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:28,027
to some cluster centroid, and

104
00:03:28,034 --> 00:03:30,024
I'll denote my cluster centroid with a cross.

105
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:32,012
So if that's the location of,

106
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,083
you know, Mu 5, let's

107
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:35,063
say, if x(i) has been

108
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:37,096
assigned to cluster centroid 5 in my example up there.

109
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:40,065
Then, the squared distance, that's

110
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:41,084
the squared of the distance

111
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:46,000
between the point x(i) and this

112
00:03:46,021 --> 00:03:48,040
cluster centroid, to which x(i) has been assigned.

113
00:03:49,056 --> 00:03:50,071
And what K-means can be shown

114
00:03:51,006 --> 00:03:52,053
to be doing is that, it

115
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:54,047
is trying to find parameters c(i)

116
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,040
and Mu(i), try to

117
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,084
find cMU to try to

118
00:03:58,096 --> 00:04:00,044
minimize this cost function J.

119
00:04:01,043 --> 00:04:03,018
This cost function is sometimes

120
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:06,077
also called the distortion cost

121
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:10,003
function or the distortion of

122
00:04:10,024 --> 00:04:12,012
the K-means algorithm.

123
00:04:12,078 --> 00:04:13,036
And, just to provide a little bit more

124
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:15,075
detail, here's the K-means algorithm,

125
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:16,044
Here's exactly the algorithm as we have it, in the real

126
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:17,095
form the earlier slide.

127
00:04:18,094 --> 00:04:20,019
And what this first step

128
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:23,012
of this algorithm is, this was

129
00:04:23,082 --> 00:04:25,091
the cluster assignment step

130
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:29,085
where we assign each

131
00:04:30,002 --> 00:04:32,091
point to the cluster centroid, and

132
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,082
it's possible to show mathematically that

133
00:04:35,005 --> 00:04:36,020
what the cluster assignment step

134
00:04:36,044 --> 00:04:38,056
is doing is exactly minimizing

135
00:04:40,076 --> 00:04:42,094
J with respect

136
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:45,089
to the variables, C1, C2

137
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:48,005
and so on, up

138
00:04:48,017 --> 00:04:52,002
to C(m), while holding the

139
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:54,024
closest centroids, MU1 up to

140
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:57,000
MUK fixed.

141
00:04:58,057 --> 00:04:59,063
So, what the first assignment step

142
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:00,099
does is you know, it doesn't change

143
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:02,085
the cluster centroids, but what it's

144
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:05,073
doing is, exactly picking the values of C1, C2, up to CM

145
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:10,024
that minimizes the cost

146
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,079
function or the distortion function,

147
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,043
J. And it's possible to prove

148
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:16,055
that mathematically but, I won't do so here.

149
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,020
That has a pretty intuitive meaning

150
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:19,062
of just, yo know, well let's assign

151
00:05:20,008 --> 00:05:21,004
these points to the cluster centroid

152
00:05:21,052 --> 00:05:22,081
that is closest to it, because

153
00:05:23,012 --> 00:05:24,016
that's what minimizes the square

154
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:26,086
of distance between the points and the corresponding cluster centroid.

155
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,008
And then the other part of

156
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,087
the second step of K-means, this second step over here.

157
00:05:33,095 --> 00:05:35,048
This second step was the move

158
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:38,076
centroid step and,

159
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,001
once again, I won't prove it,

160
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,025
but it can be shown

161
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:42,058
mathematically, that what the

162
00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:44,091
root centroid step does, is

163
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:46,074
it chooses the values

164
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:49,037
of mu that minimizes J.

165
00:05:50,014 --> 00:05:51,026
So it minimizes the cost function

166
00:05:51,064 --> 00:05:53,000
J with respect to,

167
00:05:53,037 --> 00:05:54,070
where wrt is my

168
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:56,093
abbreviation for with respect to.

169
00:05:57,002 --> 00:05:58,037
But it minimizes J with respect

170
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,093
to the locations of the cluster centroids, Mu1 through MuK.

171
00:06:02,004 --> 00:06:05,068
So, what K-means really

172
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,091
is doing is it's taking the

173
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,037
two sets of variables and

174
00:06:09,006 --> 00:06:11,020
partitioning them into two halves right here.

175
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:14,049
First the C set of variables and then you have the Mu sets of variables.

176
00:06:15,044 --> 00:06:15,099
And what it does is it first

177
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:17,075
minimizes J with respect

178
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:19,035
to the variable C, and then minimizes

179
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:20,061
J with respect the variables

180
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:22,058
Mu, and then it keeps on iterating.

181
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,068
And so that's all that K-means does.

182
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:28,056
And, now that we understand

183
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,087
K-means, let's try to

184
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:32,018
minimize this cost function J.  We

185
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:33,063
can also use this to

186
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,088
try to debug our learning

187
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:36,035
algorithm and just kind

188
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:37,098
of make sure that our implementation

189
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:39,094
of K-means is running correctly.

190
00:06:41,022 --> 00:06:42,056
So, we now understand the

191
00:06:43,006 --> 00:06:44,025
K-means algorithm as trying to

192
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:45,095
optimize this cost function J,

193
00:06:46,063 --> 00:06:48,079
which is also called the dispulsion function.

194
00:06:50,064 --> 00:06:51,060
We can use that to debug K-means

195
00:06:52,008 --> 00:06:53,006
and help me show that K-means

196
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,005
is converging, and that it's

197
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,016
running properly, and in the

198
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:57,045
next video, we'll also see

199
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:59,004
how we can us this to

200
00:06:59,012 --> 00:07:00,064
help K-means find better clusters

201
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,024
and help K-means to avoid local optima.
