1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:01,033
In this video, I'd like to

2
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,056
start talking about a second

3
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,062
type of unsupervised learning problem

4
00:00:04,095 --> 00:00:06,032
called dimensionality reduction.

5
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:08,046
There are a couple of different

6
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:09,071
reasons why one might

7
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:11,026
want to do dimensionality reduction.

8
00:00:12,022 --> 00:00:14,041
One is data compression, and as

9
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:15,085
we'll see later, a few videos

10
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:18,019
later, data compression not only

11
00:00:18,048 --> 00:00:19,066
allows us to compress the

12
00:00:19,096 --> 00:00:20,094
data and have it therefore

13
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:22,067
use up less computer memory

14
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:24,041
or disk space, but it will

15
00:00:24,073 --> 00:00:26,096
also allow us to speed up our learning algorithms.

16
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:29,048
But first, let's start by

17
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:31,083
talking about what is dimensionality reduction.

18
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:35,079
As a motivating example, let's say

19
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:37,043
that we've collected a data set

20
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:38,070
with many, many, many features,

21
00:00:39,028 --> 00:00:40,060
and I've plotted just two of them here.

22
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,077
And let's say that unknown to

23
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:44,000
us two of the

24
00:00:44,007 --> 00:00:45,072
features were actually the length

25
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:47,014
of something in centimeters, and

26
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:48,092
a different feature, x2, is

27
00:00:49,046 --> 00:00:51,014
the length of the same thing in inches.

28
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:53,003
So, this gives us a highly

29
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,090
redundant representation and maybe

30
00:00:56,017 --> 00:00:57,092
instead of having two separate features x1

31
00:00:58,042 --> 00:00:58,082
then x2,

32
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:00,024
both of which basically measure the

33
00:01:00,036 --> 00:01:01,049
length, maybe what we

34
00:01:01,064 --> 00:01:03,034
want to do is reduce the

35
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:06,079
data to one-dimensional and

36
00:01:06,092 --> 00:01:08,084
just have one number measuring this length.

37
00:01:09,062 --> 00:01:11,007
In case this example seems a

38
00:01:11,015 --> 00:01:13,092
bit contrived, this centimeter and

39
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:15,084
inches example is actually not that

40
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:17,014
unrealistic, and not that different

41
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:18,087
from things that I see happening in industry.

42
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:21,031
If you have hundreds

43
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,015
or thousands of features, it is

44
00:01:23,023 --> 00:01:24,045
often this easy to

45
00:01:24,068 --> 00:01:26,057
lose track of exactly what features you have.

46
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:28,018
And sometimes may have

47
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:29,065
a few different engineering teams, maybe

48
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,009
one engineering team gives you

49
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,050
two hundred features, a second

50
00:01:32,076 --> 00:01:34,000
engineering team gives you another

51
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:35,042
three hundred features, and a

52
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:36,064
third engineering team gives you five

53
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:38,015
hundred features so you have

54
00:01:38,029 --> 00:01:39,021
a thousand features all together,

55
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:40,090
and it actually becomes hard to

56
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:42,081
keep track of you know, exactly which features

57
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,054
you got from which team, and

58
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:47,031
it's actually not that want to have highly redundant features like these.

59
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:49,043
And so if the

60
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,051
length in centimeters were rounded

61
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:53,092
off to the nearest centimeter and

62
00:01:54,006 --> 00:01:56,048
lengthened inches was rounded off to the nearest inch.

63
00:01:57,006 --> 00:01:58,004
Then, that's why these examples

64
00:01:58,071 --> 00:01:59,090
don't lie perfectly on a

65
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:01,026
straight line, because of, you know, round-off

66
00:02:01,073 --> 00:02:03,042
error to the nearest centimeter or the nearest inch.

67
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:05,015
And if we can reduce

68
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,068
the data to one dimension

69
00:02:07,012 --> 00:02:10,031
instead of two dimensions, that reduces the redundancy.

70
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:14,003
For a different example, again maybe when there seems fairly less contrives.

71
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:16,056
For may years I've

72
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:19,091
been working with autonomous helicopter pilots.

73
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,061
Or I've been working with pilots that fly helicopters.

74
00:02:23,094 --> 00:02:24,003
And so.

75
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:28,009
If you were to measure--if you

76
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:29,009
were to, you know, do a survey

77
00:02:29,059 --> 00:02:30,050
or do a test of these different

78
00:02:30,077 --> 00:02:32,019
pilots--you might have one

79
00:02:32,043 --> 00:02:33,078
feature, x1, which is maybe

80
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:35,059
the skill of these

81
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:38,018
helicopter pilots, and maybe

82
00:02:38,046 --> 00:02:41,081
"x2" could be the pilot enjoyment.

83
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:43,077
That is, you know, how

84
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:45,005
much they enjoy flying, and maybe

85
00:02:45,028 --> 00:02:46,081
these two features will be highly correlated. And

86
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:49,072
what you really care about might

87
00:02:49,093 --> 00:02:52,053
be this sort of

88
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:55,012
this sort of, this direction, a different feature that really

89
00:02:55,037 --> 00:02:57,018
measures pilot aptitude.

90
00:03:00,044 --> 00:03:01,024
And I'm making up the name

91
00:03:01,059 --> 00:03:03,021
aptitude of course, but again, if

92
00:03:03,031 --> 00:03:04,078
you highly correlated features, maybe

93
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:06,050
you really want to reduce the dimension.

94
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:08,075
So, let me say a

95
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:09,094
little bit more about what it

96
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:11,038
really means to reduce the

97
00:03:11,052 --> 00:03:12,094
dimension of the data from

98
00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:14,040
2 dimensions down from 2D

99
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:16,030
to 1 dimensional or to 1D.

100
00:03:16,084 --> 00:03:18,065
Let me color in

101
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:19,093
these examples by using different

102
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:21,059
colors.

103
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:22,088
And in this case

104
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,074
by reducing the dimension what

105
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,031
I mean is that I would

106
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:28,040
like to find maybe this

107
00:03:28,065 --> 00:03:30,056
line, this, you know, direction on

108
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:31,069
which most of the data seems

109
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,015
to lie and project all

110
00:03:33,037 --> 00:03:34,074
the data onto that line which

111
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,022
is true, and by doing

112
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,043
so, what I can do

113
00:03:37,096 --> 00:03:39,041
is just measure the

114
00:03:39,058 --> 00:03:41,047
position of each of the examples on that line.

115
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,081
And what I can do is come

116
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:45,008
up with a new feature, z1,

117
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,019
and to specify the position

118
00:03:48,072 --> 00:03:49,053
on the line I need only

119
00:03:49,088 --> 00:03:50,093
one number, so it says

120
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:51,097
z1 is a new feature

121
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:54,062
that specifies the location of

122
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:57,061
each of those points on this green line.

123
00:03:58,006 --> 00:03:59,030
And what this means, is

124
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,068
that where as previously if i

125
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:02,053
had an example x1, maybe

126
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,074
this was my first example, x1.

127
00:04:05,003 --> 00:04:06,047
So in order to

128
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:08,055
represent x1 originally x1.

129
00:04:09,062 --> 00:04:10,075
I needed a two dimensional number,

130
00:04:11,056 --> 00:04:12,080
or a two dimensional feature vector.

131
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:14,091
Instead now I can represent

132
00:04:18,012 --> 00:04:20,032
z1. I could

133
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,017
use just z1 to represent my first

134
00:04:23,026 --> 00:04:25,037
example, and that's going to be a real number.

135
00:04:25,093 --> 00:04:29,025
And similarly x2 you know, if x2

136
00:04:29,058 --> 00:04:31,039
is my second example there,

137
00:04:32,068 --> 00:04:35,011
then previously, whereas this required

138
00:04:35,082 --> 00:04:37,051
two numbers to represent if I

139
00:04:37,072 --> 00:04:39,093
instead compute the projection

140
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:42,073
of that black cross

141
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:44,025
onto the line.

142
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:45,098
And now I only need one

143
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,035
real number which is

144
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:49,057
z2 to represent the

145
00:04:49,062 --> 00:04:51,023
location of this point

146
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,006
z2 on the line.

147
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,073
And so on through my M examples.

148
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,056
So, just to summarize, if

149
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:01,031
we allow ourselves to approximate

150
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:03,080
the original data set by

151
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,026
projecting all of my

152
00:05:05,058 --> 00:05:07,068
original examples onto this green

153
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:10,025
line over here, then I

154
00:05:10,036 --> 00:05:12,008
need only one number, I

155
00:05:12,017 --> 00:05:13,069
need only real number to

156
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:15,026
specify the position of

157
00:05:15,037 --> 00:05:16,070
a point on the line,

158
00:05:17,007 --> 00:05:18,022
and so what I can

159
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,073
do is therefore use just

160
00:05:20,006 --> 00:05:21,085
one number to represent the

161
00:05:21,093 --> 00:05:23,017
location of each of

162
00:05:23,027 --> 00:05:26,051
my training examples after they've been projected onto that green line.

163
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:29,006
So this is an approximation to

164
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,030
the original training self because

165
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:32,076
I have projected all of my training examples onto a line.

166
00:05:33,062 --> 00:05:34,079
But

167
00:05:35,012 --> 00:05:36,013
now, I need to keep around

168
00:05:36,052 --> 00:05:39,080
only one number for each of my examples.

169
00:05:41,022 --> 00:05:42,095
And so this halves the memory

170
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:44,063
requirement, or a space requirement,

171
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:47,075
or what have you, for how to store my data.

172
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,052
And perhaps more interestingly, more

173
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:51,093
importantly, what we'll see

174
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,051
later, in the later

175
00:05:53,077 --> 00:05:55,073
video as well is that this

176
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:56,093
will allow us to make

177
00:05:57,019 --> 00:05:59,017
our learning algorithms run more quickly as well.

178
00:05:59,048 --> 00:06:00,060
And that is actually,

179
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:02,006
perhaps, even the more interesting

180
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:03,080
application of this data compression

181
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:06,022
rather than reducing the memory

182
00:06:06,068 --> 00:06:08,062
or disk space requirement for storing the data.

183
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:11,049
On the previous slide we

184
00:06:11,057 --> 00:06:13,013
showed an example of reducing

185
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:15,006
data from 2D to 1D.

186
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,029
On this slide, I'm going

187
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:18,000
to show another example of reducing

188
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,007
data from three dimensional 3D to two dimensional 2D.

189
00:06:22,058 --> 00:06:23,036
By the way, in the more typical

190
00:06:23,075 --> 00:06:25,056
example of dimensionality reduction

191
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:27,079
we might have a thousand dimensional

192
00:06:28,023 --> 00:06:30,032
data or 1000D data that

193
00:06:30,072 --> 00:06:31,087
we might want to reduce to

194
00:06:32,014 --> 00:06:34,007
let's say a hundred dimensional or

195
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:35,058
100D, but because of

196
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:37,075
the limitations of what I can plot on the slide.

197
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:41,051
I'm going to use examples of 3D to 2D, or 2D to 1D.

198
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:45,082
So, let's have a data set like that shown here.

199
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,042
And so, I would have a set of examples

200
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:49,043
x(i) which are points

201
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,079
in r3. So, I have three dimension examples.

202
00:06:52,074 --> 00:06:53,030
I know it might be a little

203
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:54,061
bit hard to see this on the slide,

204
00:06:54,092 --> 00:06:55,098
but I'll show a 3D point

205
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:58,018
cloud in a little bit.

206
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:00,027
And it might be hard to see

207
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:01,097
here, but all of this

208
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:04,001
data maybe lies roughly on

209
00:07:04,012 --> 00:07:05,069
the plane, like so.

210
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:08,012
And so what we can do

211
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:09,097
with dimensionality reduction, is take

212
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,095
all of this data and

213
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:13,080
project the data down onto

214
00:07:14,062 --> 00:07:15,035
a two dimensional plane.

215
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:16,067
So, here what I've done is,

216
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:18,006
I've taken all the data and I've

217
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,025
projected all of the data,

218
00:07:19,076 --> 00:07:21,038
so that it all lies on the plane.

219
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:23,091
Now, finally, in order to

220
00:07:24,004 --> 00:07:25,057
specify the location of a

221
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:27,081
point within a plane, we need two numbers, right?

222
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,014
We need to, maybe, specify the

223
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:30,066
location of a point along

224
00:07:30,097 --> 00:07:32,037
this axis, and then also

225
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:35,008
specify it's location along that axis.

226
00:07:35,073 --> 00:07:37,047
So, we need two numbers, maybe called

227
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:39,089
z1 and z2 to specify

228
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,044
the location of a point within a plane.

229
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,073
And so, what that means,

230
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,091
is that we can now represent

231
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:48,031
each example, each training example,

232
00:07:48,074 --> 00:07:50,031
using two numbers that

233
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:52,094
I've drawn here, z1, and z2.

234
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,088
So, our data can be represented

235
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:59,012
using vector z which are in r2.

236
00:08:00,057 --> 00:08:02,011
And these subscript, z subscript

237
00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:03,099
1, z subscript 2, what

238
00:08:04,056 --> 00:08:05,043
I just mean by that is that my

239
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,051
vectors here, z, you know, are two

240
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:09,068
dimensional vectors, z1, z2.

241
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,057
And so if I have some

242
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,068
particular examples, z(i), or

243
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,069
that's the two dimensional vector, z(i)1,

244
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:19,011
z(i)2.

245
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:21,099
And on the previous slide when

246
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:23,075
I was reducing data to one

247
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:25,026
dimensional data then I

248
00:08:25,036 --> 00:08:27,050
had only z1, right?

249
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:28,061
And that is what a z1 subscript 1

250
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:29,082
on the previous slide was,

251
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:31,072
but here I have two dimensional data,

252
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,073
so I have z1 and z2 as

253
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:34,094
the two components of the data.

254
00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:37,083
Now, let me just make sure

255
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:39,020
that these figures make sense. So

256
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:40,078
let me just reshow these exact

257
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,008
three figures again but with 3D plots.

258
00:08:45,053 --> 00:08:46,057
So the process we went through was that

259
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:48,011
shown in the lab is the optimal

260
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:49,051
data set, in the middle the

261
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:50,053
data set projects on the 2D,

262
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:52,013
and on the right the 2D

263
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:54,089
data sets with z1 and z2 as the axis.

264
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,061
Let's look at them a little

265
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:57,096
bit further. Here's my original

266
00:08:58,026 --> 00:08:59,021
data set, shown on the

267
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,067
left, and so I had started

268
00:09:01,037 --> 00:09:02,041
off with a 3D point

269
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:04,000
cloud like so, where the

270
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:05,038
axis are labeled x1,

271
00:09:05,057 --> 00:09:07,040
x2, x3, and so there's a 3D

272
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:08,097
point but most of the data,

273
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,075
maybe roughly lies on some,

274
00:09:10,085 --> 00:09:12,079
you know, not too far from some 2D plain.

275
00:09:13,092 --> 00:09:14,095
So, what we can

276
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:17,046
do is take this data and here's my middle figure.

277
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:19,011
I'm going to project it onto 2D.

278
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:20,078
So, I've projected this data so

279
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:23,022
that all of it now lies on this 2D surface.

280
00:09:23,075 --> 00:09:25,033
As you can see all the data

281
00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:27,047
lies on a plane, 'cause we've

282
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,051
projected everything onto a

283
00:09:30,057 --> 00:09:31,049
plane, and so what this means is that

284
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:33,019
now I need only two numbers,

285
00:09:33,082 --> 00:09:35,009
z1 and z2, to represent

286
00:09:35,062 --> 00:09:37,047
the location of point on the plane.

287
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:41,048
And so that's the process that

288
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,099
we can go through to reduce our

289
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,017
data from three dimensional to

290
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:48,051
two dimensional. So that's

291
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:50,085
dimensionality reduction and how

292
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,074
we can use it to compress our data.

293
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,039
And as we'll see

294
00:09:55,058 --> 00:09:56,097
later this will allow us to

295
00:09:57,011 --> 00:09:58,001
make some of our learning algorithms

296
00:09:58,058 --> 00:09:59,066
run much later as well, but

297
00:09:59,074 --> 00:10:01,021
we'll get to that only in a later video.
