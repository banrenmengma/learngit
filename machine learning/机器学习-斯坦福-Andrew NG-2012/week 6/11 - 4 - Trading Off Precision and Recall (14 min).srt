1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:01,052
In the last video, we talked

2
00:00:01,082 --> 00:00:04,012
about precision and recall as

3
00:00:04,028 --> 00:00:06,017
an evaluation metric for classification

4
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:08,022
problems with skew classes.

5
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:11,001
For many applications, we'll want

6
00:00:11,017 --> 00:00:13,034
to somehow control the trade

7
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:15,064
off between position and recall.

8
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,030
Let me tell you how

9
00:00:17,046 --> 00:00:19,001
to do that and also show

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,051
you some, even more effective

11
00:00:21,005 --> 00:00:22,080
ways to use precision and

12
00:00:22,098 --> 00:00:24,028
recall as an evaluation

13
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:27,037
metric for learning algorithms.

14
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:30,017
As a reminder, here are the

15
00:00:30,025 --> 00:00:32,014
definitions of precision and

16
00:00:32,038 --> 00:00:34,010
recall from the previous video.

17
00:00:35,092 --> 00:00:37,064
Let's continue our cancer classification

18
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:39,097
example, where y equals

19
00:00:40,036 --> 00:00:41,078
one if the patient has cancer

20
00:00:42,027 --> 00:00:43,031
and y equals zero otherwise.

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,006
And let's say we've trained in

22
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:48,057
logistic regression classifier, which outputs

23
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,068
probabilities between zero and one.

24
00:00:51,074 --> 00:00:52,082
So, as usual, we're

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,068
going to predict one, y equals

26
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:56,028
one if h of x

27
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,097
is greater than or equal to

28
00:00:58,009 --> 00:00:59,071
0.5 and predict zero if

29
00:01:00,014 --> 00:01:01,057
the hypothesis outputs a value

30
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:03,071
less than 0.5 and this

31
00:01:04,004 --> 00:01:05,040
classifier may give us

32
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,043
some value for precision and some value for recall.

33
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:11,085
But now, suppose we want

34
00:01:12,014 --> 00:01:13,043
to predict that a patient

35
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,051
has cancer only if we're

36
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,018
very confident that they really do.

37
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:18,090
Because you know if you go

38
00:01:19,014 --> 00:01:20,018
to a patient and you tell

39
00:01:20,048 --> 00:01:21,056
them that they have cancer, it's

40
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,045
going to give them a huge

41
00:01:22,068 --> 00:01:23,085
shock because this is seriously

42
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:25,060
bad news and they may

43
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,007
end up going through a pretty

44
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:29,056
painful treatment process and so on.

45
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:30,076
And so maybe we want to

46
00:01:30,098 --> 00:01:31,087
tell someone that we think

47
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,023
they have cancer only if they're very confident.

48
00:01:36,023 --> 00:01:37,020
One way to do this would

49
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:38,093
be to modify the algorithm, so

50
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:40,029
that instead of setting the

51
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,026
threshold at 0.5, we

52
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:44,035
might instead say that we'll

53
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:45,037
predict that y is equal

54
00:01:46,032 --> 00:01:48,062
to 1, only if H of

55
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,020
x is greater than or equal to 0.7.

56
00:01:50,048 --> 00:01:51,062
So this, I think

57
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:53,040
will tell someone if they

58
00:01:53,051 --> 00:01:54,053
have cancer only if we think

59
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:56,028
there's a greater than, greater

60
00:01:56,073 --> 00:01:59,006
than or equal to 70% that they have cancer.

61
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:02,000
And if you do this then

62
00:02:02,084 --> 00:02:03,073
you're predicting some of this

63
00:02:03,084 --> 00:02:04,098
cancer only when you're

64
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:07,023
more confident, and so

65
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:08,083
you end up with a classifier

66
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:13,040
that has higher precision, because

67
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:15,030
all the patients that you're

68
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:16,062
going to and say, you know,

69
00:02:16,086 --> 00:02:18,021
we think you have cancer, all

70
00:02:18,043 --> 00:02:19,075
of those patients are now

71
00:02:20,034 --> 00:02:21,041
pretty, once they hear, pretty

72
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:23,009
confident they actually have cancer.

73
00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:26,005
And so, a higher fraction of

74
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:27,046
the patients that you predict to

75
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:28,099
have cancer, will actually turn

76
00:02:29,028 --> 00:02:30,071
out to have cancer, because in

77
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,087
making those predictions we are pretty confident.

78
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,036
But in contrast, this classifier will

79
00:02:36,053 --> 00:02:38,053
have lower recall, because

80
00:02:39,013 --> 00:02:40,021
now we are going

81
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,065
to make predictions, we are

82
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:44,018
going to predict y equals one, on a smaller number of patients.

83
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:45,091
Now we could even take this further.

84
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:47,052
Instead of setting the threshold

85
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:49,021
at 0.7, we can set

86
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:51,055
this at 0.9 and we'll predict

87
00:02:52,043 --> 00:02:53,027
y1 only if we are

88
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:54,056
more than 90% certain that

89
00:02:55,037 --> 00:02:57,002
the patient has cancer, and so,

90
00:02:57,059 --> 00:02:58,071
you know, a large fraction that

91
00:02:58,084 --> 00:02:59,081
those patients will turn out

92
00:03:00,002 --> 00:03:01,037
to have cancer and so,

93
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,006
this is the high precision classifier

94
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:06,009
will have lower recall because we

95
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:08,055
want to correctly detect that those patients have cancer.

96
00:03:09,031 --> 00:03:10,078
Now consider a different example.

97
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:13,019
Suppose we want to avoid

98
00:03:13,046 --> 00:03:15,053
missing too many actual cases of cancer.

99
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:17,047
So we want to avoid the false negatives.

100
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:19,081
In particular, if a patient

101
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,028
actually has cancer, but we

102
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:23,069
fail to tell them that

103
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:25,071
they have cancer, then that can be really bad.

104
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:27,046
Because if we tell

105
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:28,087
a patient that they don't

106
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:31,046
have cancer then they are

107
00:03:31,053 --> 00:03:32,087
not going to go for treatment and

108
00:03:32,097 --> 00:03:33,088
if it turns out that they

109
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,037
have cancer or we fail

110
00:03:35,052 --> 00:03:36,040
to tell them they have

111
00:03:36,065 --> 00:03:39,006
cancer, well they may not get treated at all.

112
00:03:39,043 --> 00:03:40,052
And so that would be

113
00:03:40,063 --> 00:03:41,081
a really bad outcome because he

114
00:03:42,008 --> 00:03:43,005
died because we told them

115
00:03:43,013 --> 00:03:44,056
they don't have cancer they failed

116
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:46,078
to get treated, but it turns

117
00:03:48,022 --> 00:03:48,078
out that they actually have cancer.

118
00:03:49,025 --> 00:03:50,025
When in doubt, we want to

119
00:03:50,036 --> 00:03:52,043
predict that y equals one.

120
00:03:52,071 --> 00:03:54,025
So when in doubt, we want

121
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:55,050
to predict that they have

122
00:03:55,077 --> 00:03:56,081
cancer so that at least

123
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:58,015
they look further into it

124
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,071
and this can get treated,

125
00:04:01,018 --> 00:04:02,075
in case they do turn out to have cancer.

126
00:04:04,087 --> 00:04:06,030
In this case, rather than setting

127
00:04:06,075 --> 00:04:08,091
higher probability threshold, we might

128
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:11,037
instead take this value

129
00:04:12,027 --> 00:04:13,031
and this then sets it to

130
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,071
a lower value, so maybe

131
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:17,038
0.3 like so.

132
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:19,077
By doing so, we're saying

133
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:21,037
that, you know what, if we

134
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:22,018
think there's more than a 30%

135
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:24,066
chance that they have caner, we better

136
00:04:24,088 --> 00:04:26,026
be more conservative and tell

137
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,032
them that they may have cancer,

138
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:29,061
so they can seek treatment if necessary.

139
00:04:31,011 --> 00:04:32,062
And in this case, what

140
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,019
we would have is going to

141
00:04:35,012 --> 00:04:38,025
be a higher recall classifier,

142
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:41,043
because we're going to

143
00:04:41,057 --> 00:04:43,032
be correctly flagging a higher

144
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:44,075
fraction of all of

145
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,092
the patients that actually do have

146
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:47,056
cancer, but we're going

147
00:04:47,074 --> 00:04:51,004
to end up with lower precision,

148
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:53,049
because the higher fraction of

149
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,069
the patients that we said have

150
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:57,052
cancer, the higher fraction of them will turn out not to have cancer after all.

151
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:01,031
And by the way, just as an

152
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,063
aside, when I talk

153
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:04,089
about this to other

154
00:05:05,016 --> 00:05:07,075
students up until before, it's pretty amazing.

155
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:09,072
Some of my say is

156
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:11,095
how I can tell the story both ways.

157
00:05:12,055 --> 00:05:14,022
Why we might want to have

158
00:05:14,044 --> 00:05:15,049
higher precision or higher recall

159
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:18,056
and the story actually seems to work both ways.

160
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:20,055
But I hope the details of

161
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:22,072
the algorithm is true and the

162
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:24,036
more general principle is, depending

163
00:05:24,077 --> 00:05:26,014
on where you want, whether

164
00:05:26,032 --> 00:05:28,000
you want high precision, lower recall

165
00:05:28,054 --> 00:05:30,033
or higher recall, lower precision, you

166
00:05:30,044 --> 00:05:32,010
can end up predicting y equals

167
00:05:32,054 --> 00:05:35,004
one when each of x is greater than some threshold.

168
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:39,024
And so, in general, for

169
00:05:39,087 --> 00:05:41,032
most crossfires, there is going

170
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:44,019
to be a trade off between precision and recall.

171
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:46,054
And as you vary the value

172
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:48,069
of this threshold, this value,

173
00:05:49,002 --> 00:05:49,085
this special that I have

174
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:51,047
joined here, you can actually

175
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:53,085
plot us some curve that

176
00:05:54,002 --> 00:05:56,006
trades off precision and

177
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:58,000
recall, where a value

178
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,001
up here, this would correspond

179
00:06:01,036 --> 00:06:02,062
to a very high value of

180
00:06:02,076 --> 00:06:04,049
the threshold, maybe threshold equals

181
00:06:05,042 --> 00:06:06,079
over 0.99, so that say, predict

182
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:08,026
y equals 1 only where

183
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:09,063
no more than 99 percent

184
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:11,069
confident, at least 99

185
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:13,045
percent probability this once, so

186
00:06:13,075 --> 00:06:15,038
that will be a precision relatively

187
00:06:15,095 --> 00:06:17,055
low recall, whereas the point

188
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:20,037
down here will correspond to

189
00:06:20,049 --> 00:06:22,024
a value of the threshold that's

190
00:06:22,044 --> 00:06:24,093
much lower, maybe 0.01.

191
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,081
When in doubt at all, put down y1.

192
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,037
And if you do that, you

193
00:06:28,051 --> 00:06:29,056
end up with a much

194
00:06:29,075 --> 00:06:31,073
lower precision higher recall crossfire.

195
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:34,097
And as you vary the threshold, if

196
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:36,055
you want, you can actually trace

197
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,027
all the curve from your crossfire

198
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:41,042
to see the range of different values you can get for precision recall.

199
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:43,081
And by the way, the position

200
00:06:44,023 --> 00:06:46,086
recall curve can look like many different shapes.

201
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:49,013
Sometimes it'll look this, sometimes

202
00:06:50,055 --> 00:06:51,025
it'll look like that.

203
00:06:52,032 --> 00:06:53,020
Now, there are many different possible

204
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:54,081
shapes in the position of recall

205
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:56,085
curve, depending on the details of the crossfire.

206
00:06:57,099 --> 00:06:59,062
So this raises another

207
00:06:59,089 --> 00:07:01,068
interesting question which is, is

208
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,012
there a way to choose

209
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,010
this threshold automatically?

210
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:07,088
Or, more generally, if we have

211
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,006
a few different algorithms or a

212
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:12,029
few different ideas for algorithms, how

213
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:15,033
do we compare different precision recall numbers?

214
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:16,039
completely.

215
00:07:17,017 --> 00:07:18,025
Suppose we have three different

216
00:07:18,058 --> 00:07:20,005
learning algorithms, or actually maybe

217
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:22,006
these are three different learning algorithms, may

218
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,000
be these are the same algorithm, but just with different values for the threshold.

219
00:07:26,018 --> 00:07:28,056
How do we decide which of these algorithms is best?

220
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:30,045
One of the things we talked

221
00:07:30,068 --> 00:07:31,062
about earlier is the importance

222
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,058
of a single real number evaluation metric.

223
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,088
And that is the idea of

224
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:38,005
having a number that just

225
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:40,012
tells you how well is your Crossfire doing.

226
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:42,025
But by switching to the precision

227
00:07:42,068 --> 00:07:44,032
recall metric, we've actually lost that.

228
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:46,008
We now have two real numbers.

229
00:07:47,018 --> 00:07:48,060
And so we often end up

230
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:50,057
facing situations, like if

231
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:52,076
we are trying to compare algorithm 1

232
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,035
to algorithm 2, we

233
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:55,042
end up asking ourselves, Is a

234
00:07:55,044 --> 00:07:56,055
position of point five and

235
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:57,057
a recall of point four, well

236
00:07:57,082 --> 00:07:58,082
is that better or worse than

237
00:07:58,095 --> 00:08:00,012
a position of point seven or

238
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,088
a recall point one?

239
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,001
If every time you try

240
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:04,073
on a new algorithm you end up

241
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:06,006
having to sit around and think

242
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,070
well, maybe point five

243
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:09,017
point four, is better than point

244
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:11,012
seven point one, maybe not, I do not know.

245
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:13,074
If you end up having to sit around and think and make these decisions.

246
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:15,082
that really slows down your

247
00:08:16,002 --> 00:08:18,070
decision making process, for what

248
00:08:19,012 --> 00:08:21,056
changes are useful to incorporate into your algorithm.

249
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:24,081
Where as in contrast, if we

250
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,041
had a single real number evaluation metric,

251
00:08:27,022 --> 00:08:28,024
like a number that just

252
00:08:28,058 --> 00:08:31,013
tells us is either algorithm 1 or is algorithm 2 better.

253
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,011
That helps us much more

254
00:08:33,037 --> 00:08:34,084
quickly decide which algorithm to

255
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:36,028
go with and helps us

256
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:37,051
as well to much more quickly

257
00:08:38,011 --> 00:08:39,070
evaluate different changes that we

258
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:41,037
may be contemplating for an algorithm.

259
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:43,008
So, how can we get

260
00:08:43,048 --> 00:08:45,090
a single real number evaluation metric.

261
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:48,059
One natural thing that you

262
00:08:48,065 --> 00:08:49,090
might try is to look

263
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:52,011
at the average between precision and recall.

264
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,030
So using p and r

265
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:54,079
to denote position and recall, what

266
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,029
you could do is just compute the

267
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:57,027
average and look at what crossfire

268
00:08:57,076 --> 00:08:59,029
has the highest average value.

269
00:09:00,084 --> 00:09:01,099
But this turns out not to

270
00:09:02,003 --> 00:09:04,099
be such a good solution because, similar

271
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:06,048
to the example we had earlier,

272
00:09:07,086 --> 00:09:08,097
it turns out that if we

273
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,025
have a crossfire that predicts

274
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,083
y1 all the time, then if

275
00:09:13,096 --> 00:09:15,053
you do that, you can get a very high recall.

276
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:18,070
That's you end up with a very low value of Vision.

277
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:21,023
Conversely,if you have a crossfire

278
00:09:21,063 --> 00:09:24,005
that predicts y0 almost all

279
00:09:25,034 --> 00:09:26,039
the time, that is, if

280
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:28,010
it predicts y one very sparingly.

281
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,082
This corresponds to setting

282
00:09:31,012 --> 00:09:34,019
a very high threshold using the notation of previous line.

283
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:35,061
And then you can actually

284
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:37,064
end up with a very high precision with a very low recall.

285
00:09:39,027 --> 00:09:40,047
So the two extremes of either

286
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:42,037
are a very high threshold or a

287
00:09:42,053 --> 00:09:44,004
very low threshold, neither of

288
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,061
them would give it paticularary good crossfire.

289
00:09:46,027 --> 00:09:47,055
And we recognize that is

290
00:09:47,064 --> 00:09:48,064
by seeing if we end

291
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:49,083
up with a very low

292
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:52,071
precision or a very low recall.

293
00:09:54,013 --> 00:09:56,012
And if you just take the average of people's ro2.

294
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,098
One does the example the average

295
00:09:59,075 --> 00:10:01,040
is actually highest for algorithm 3.

296
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,079
Even though you can get

297
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,000
that sort of performance by predicting

298
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,085
y1 all the time.

299
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,058
And that is just not a very good classifier, right?

300
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,067
You predict y equals one all

301
00:10:09,077 --> 00:10:11,000
the time is just not a

302
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:13,095
useful classifier if all it does is prints out y equals one.

303
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,058
And so algorithm one or algorithm

304
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:18,008
two would be more

305
00:10:18,027 --> 00:10:19,062
useful than algorithm three,

306
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,033
but in this example algorithm three

307
00:10:23,008 --> 00:10:24,084
has a higher average value of

308
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:27,046
precision recall than algorithm one and two.

309
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:29,077
So we usually think of

310
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:31,040
this average of precision recall

311
00:10:32,027 --> 00:10:35,000
as not a particularly good way to evaluate our learning algorithm.

312
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,082
In contrast, there is a

313
00:10:40,002 --> 00:10:41,076
different way of combining precision recall.

314
00:10:42,037 --> 00:10:44,094
It is called the f score and it uses that formula.

315
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,074
So, in this example, here are the f scores.

316
00:10:49,052 --> 00:10:50,044
And so we would tell

317
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:52,013
from these f scores and

318
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,065
we'll say algorithm 1 has

319
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:55,028
the highest f score.

320
00:10:55,062 --> 00:10:56,090
Algorithm 2 has the second highest and

321
00:10:57,017 --> 00:10:58,055
algorithm 3 has the lowest and so

322
00:10:59,003 --> 00:10:59,091
you know, if we go by

323
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:02,070
the f score, we would pick probably algorithm of 1 over the others.

324
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:06,012
The f score, which is also

325
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,047
called the f1 score,

326
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,011
is usually written f1 score

327
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:11,062
that I have here, but often people will just say f score.

328
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,075
It determines use is a

329
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,012
little bit like taking the

330
00:11:16,028 --> 00:11:17,065
average of precision of recall,

331
00:11:18,008 --> 00:11:19,022
but it gives the lower

332
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:20,086
value of precision and recall

333
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:23,046
- whichever it is - it gives it a higher weight.

334
00:11:23,095 --> 00:11:25,022
And so, you see in

335
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:27,009
the numerator here that the

336
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:29,090
f score takes a product or position of equal.

337
00:11:30,046 --> 00:11:31,089
And so, if either position is

338
00:11:32,004 --> 00:11:33,007
0 or recall is equal to

339
00:11:33,017 --> 00:11:34,030
0, the f score will

340
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,059
be equal to o. So

341
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,028
in that sense, it kind of combines position and recall.

342
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:40,015
but for the f score to

343
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:41,060
be large, both position

344
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,048
and recall have to be pretty large.

345
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:45,076
I should say that there are

346
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:47,095
many different possible formulas for

347
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:49,045
combining position and recall.

348
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:51,039
This f score formula is

349
00:11:51,073 --> 00:11:53,047
really, maybe just one out

350
00:11:53,063 --> 00:11:54,079
of a much larger number of

351
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:57,020
possibilities, but historically or

352
00:11:57,026 --> 00:11:58,030
traditionally this is what

353
00:11:58,046 --> 00:12:00,011
people in machine learning use.

354
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,084
And the term f score, you

355
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,015
know, it doesn't really mean

356
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:05,046
anything, so don't worry about

357
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:07,067
why it's called f score or f1 score.

358
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,089
But this usually gives

359
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:12,023
you the effect that you want

360
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,007
because if either position is

361
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:15,040
0 or recall is 0, this

362
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:17,047
gives you a very low f score.

363
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:18,073
And so, to have a

364
00:12:18,076 --> 00:12:20,002
high f score you can't

365
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:21,078
need a preserve quality 1

366
00:12:22,023 --> 00:12:24,062
and completely if p

367
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,029
equals zero or i

368
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,044
equals zero then this

369
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:31,053
gives you the f score equals zero.

370
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:34,062
Where as a perfect f

371
00:12:34,082 --> 00:12:36,012
score, so if position equals

372
00:12:36,054 --> 00:12:38,051
one and  [xx] equals

373
00:12:38,094 --> 00:12:40,037
one that would give

374
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:43,045
you an f score that's

375
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:44,077
equal to one times one

376
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,064
over two times two.

377
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,059
So the f score will be

378
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:48,061
equal to 1 if you

379
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:50,029
have perfect precision and perfect recall.

380
00:12:51,027 --> 00:12:53,023
And intermediate values between 0

381
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:54,098
and 1, this usually gives a

382
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:57,024
reasonable rank ordering of different classifiers.

383
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,007
So this video we talked

384
00:13:01,037 --> 00:13:03,024
about the notion of trading

385
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,028
off between position and recall

386
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:07,040
and how we can vary the

387
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:09,011
threshold that we use to

388
00:13:09,025 --> 00:13:10,034
decide whether to predict y

389
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:11,098
equals one or y equals zero.

390
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:13,099
This threshold that says do

391
00:13:14,007 --> 00:13:15,017
we need to be at least

392
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,097
seventy percent confident or ninety

393
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,034
percent confident or whatever before

394
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:21,014
we predict y equals one and

395
00:13:21,025 --> 00:13:22,061
by varying the threshold you

396
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:23,092
can control a trade off

397
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:25,096
between precision and recall.

398
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:27,014
Ross talked about the f score

399
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,085
which takes precision and recall

400
00:13:29,063 --> 00:13:30,073
and gives you a single

401
00:13:31,026 --> 00:13:32,048
real number evaluation metric.

402
00:13:33,032 --> 00:13:34,046
And of course, if your goal is

403
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:36,059
to automatically set that

404
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:38,038
threshold, to decide which

405
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:39,032
one of y equals 1 or

406
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,017
y equals 0, one pretty

407
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,040
reasonable way to do that

408
00:13:42,074 --> 00:13:44,013
would also be to try

409
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,035
a range of different values of thresholds.

410
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,074
So, try a range of values

411
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:50,042
of thresholds and evaluate these

412
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,061
different threshold on say your

413
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:53,064
cross validation set, and then

414
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:55,075
to pick whatever value of threshold

415
00:13:56,058 --> 00:13:57,090
gives you the highest f score

416
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,075
on your cross validation setting.

417
00:14:00,012 --> 00:14:01,022
That would be a pretty reasonable way

418
00:14:01,072 --> 00:14:04,062
to automatically chose the threshold for your crossfire as well.
