1
00:00:00,027 --> 00:00:01,043
In the previous video, we talked

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,011
about Stochastic gradient descent,

3
00:00:04,016 --> 00:00:06,058
and how that can be much faster than Batch gradient descent.

4
00:00:07,044 --> 00:00:08,097
In this video, let's talk about another variation on these ideas

5
00:00:09,064 --> 00:00:10,073
is

6
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:12,043
called Mini-batch gradient descent

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,063
they can work sometimes even a

8
00:00:14,068 --> 00:00:16,039
bit faster than stochastic gradient descent.

9
00:00:19,014 --> 00:00:21,032
To summarize the algorithms we talked about so far.

10
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:23,037
In Batch gradient descent we

11
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:25,087
will use all m examples in each generation.

12
00:00:26,096 --> 00:00:27,080
Whereas in Stochastic gradient

13
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:29,026
descent we will use

14
00:00:29,053 --> 00:00:31,025
a single example in each generation.

15
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,040
What Mini-batch gradient descent does is somewhere in between.

16
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:38,006
Specifically, with this algorithm we're going to use

17
00:00:38,077 --> 00:00:40,042
b examples in each

18
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:42,024
iteration where b is

19
00:00:42,036 --> 00:00:43,082
a parameter called the mini

20
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:47,077
batch size so the

21
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,024
idea is that this

22
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,015
is somewhat in-between Batch gradient descent and Stochastic gradient descent.

23
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:54,015
This is just like batch gradient

24
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:56,084
descent, except that I'm going to use a much smaller batch size.

25
00:00:57,095 --> 00:00:59,036
A typical tourist for the

26
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:00,096
value of b might be

27
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:02,040
b equals 10 lets say

28
00:01:03,014 --> 00:01:04,062
and a typical range really might

29
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,096
be anywhere from b equals 2

30
00:01:06,012 --> 00:01:08,004
up to b equals 100.

31
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:09,062
So that will be a pretty typical

32
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:12,048
range of values for the

33
00:01:12,059 --> 00:01:14,010
Mini-batch size.

34
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:15,089
And the idea is that

35
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,051
rather than using one example

36
00:01:17,082 --> 00:01:18,060
at a time or m examples

37
00:01:18,065 --> 00:01:20,012
at a time we will use b examples at a time.

38
00:01:21,012 --> 00:01:22,009
So let me just

39
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:24,023
write this off informally, we're going

40
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:26,012
to get, let's say, b.

41
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:28,048
For this example, let's say b equals 10.

42
00:01:28,057 --> 00:01:29,054
So we're going to get, you

43
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:32,089
know, the next 10 examples from

44
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,023
my training set so that

45
00:01:34,045 --> 00:01:35,070
may be some set of

46
00:01:35,098 --> 00:01:37,037
examples xi, yi.

47
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,004
If it's 10 examples then the

48
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:41,020
indexing will be up

49
00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:44,045
to x (i+9),

50
00:01:45,046 --> 00:01:47,026
y (i+9)

51
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:49,032
so that's 10 examples altogether and

52
00:01:49,046 --> 00:01:52,026
then we'll perform essentially a

53
00:01:53,043 --> 00:01:56,057
gradient descent update using these

54
00:01:56,085 --> 00:01:59,007
10 examples. So, that's

55
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:00,085
any rate times one tenth times

56
00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:04,056
sum over k equals

57
00:02:05,015 --> 00:02:08,000
i through i+9 of x subscript theta of x(k)

58
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:10,081


59
00:02:13,074 --> 00:02:15,036
minus y(k) you times

60
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:21,028
x(k)j.
And so

61
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:24,015
in this expression, where summing the

62
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:26,047
gradient terms over my ten examples.

63
00:02:27,018 --> 00:02:28,093
So, that's number ten, that's, you know, my mini

64
00:02:29,094 --> 00:02:31,069
batch size and just i+9

65
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:32,068
again, the 9

66
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:34,046
comes from the choice of

67
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,027
the parameter b, and then

68
00:02:36,053 --> 00:02:37,046
after this we will then

69
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:41,011
increase, you know, i by

70
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,046
tenth, we will go on

71
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:44,078
to the next ten examples and then

72
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:48,068
keep moving like this. So just

73
00:02:48,072 --> 00:02:49,058
to write out the entire algorithm in

74
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:51,059
full. In order to

75
00:02:51,094 --> 00:02:53,028
simplify the indexing for

76
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,061
this one at the

77
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:55,049
right top, I'm going to

78
00:02:55,061 --> 00:02:57,003
assume we have a mini-batch size of

79
00:02:57,015 --> 00:02:58,043
ten and a training

80
00:02:58,097 --> 00:03:00,050
set size of a thousand, what we're

81
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:01,078
going to do is have this

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,086
sort of form, you know, for i

83
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:03,096
equals 1 and that in 21's

84
00:03:04,056 --> 00:03:05,075
the stepping, in steps of

85
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,074
10 because we look at

86
00:03:06,094 --> 00:03:08,068
10 examples at a time.

87
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:10,031
And then we perform this sort of

88
00:03:10,034 --> 00:03:11,071
gradient descent update using

89
00:03:12,038 --> 00:03:14,025
ten examples at a time

90
00:03:14,055 --> 00:03:16,040
so this 10 and this

91
00:03:17,012 --> 00:03:18,008
i+9 those are consequence

92
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:21,006
of having chosen my mini-batch to be ten.

93
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:25,034
And you know, this ultimate four-loop, this ends at 991

94
00:03:26,046 --> 00:03:28,036
here because if I

95
00:03:28,055 --> 00:03:30,027
have 1000 training samples then

96
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:31,052
I need 100 steps of size

97
00:03:31,096 --> 00:03:33,040
10 in order to get through my training set.

98
00:03:34,096 --> 00:03:37,009
So this is mini-batch gradient descent.

99
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:39,093
Compared to batch gradient

100
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:42,077
descent, this also allows us to make progress much faster.

101
00:03:43,037 --> 00:03:44,093
So we have again our

102
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:46,069
running example of, you know,

103
00:03:46,077 --> 00:03:47,088
U.S. Census data with 300

104
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:50,040
million training examples, then what

105
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,068
we're saying is after looking at

106
00:03:52,018 --> 00:03:53,031
just the first 10 examples

107
00:03:53,063 --> 00:03:54,083
we can start to make progress

108
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,041
in improving the parameters

109
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:58,088
theta so we don't' need

110
00:03:58,093 --> 00:04:00,058
to scan through the entire training set.

111
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:01,066
We just need to look

112
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:02,077
at the first 10 examples

113
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:04,003
and this will start letting us make

114
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:04,087
progress and then we can look at the second ten examples and modify the parameters a little bit again

115
00:04:04,093 --> 00:04:10,036
and so on. So, that

116
00:04:10,053 --> 00:04:11,088
is why Mini-batch gradient descent can be faster

117
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:13,056
than batch gradient descent.

118
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:15,050
Namely, you can start making progress

119
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,083
in modifying the parameters after

120
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:19,072
looking at just ten examples rather

121
00:04:19,087 --> 00:04:21,012
than needing to wait 'till

122
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:22,057
you've scan through every single training

123
00:04:23,073 --> 00:04:24,049
example of 300 million of them.

124
00:04:25,035 --> 00:04:26,041
So, how about Mini-batch

125
00:04:26,072 --> 00:04:29,007
gradient descent versus Stochastic gradient descent.

126
00:04:29,047 --> 00:04:30,043
So, why do we

127
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:31,072
want to look at b examples

128
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:33,064
at a time rather than

129
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:35,055
look at just a single example

130
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,032
at a time as the Stochastic gradient descent?

131
00:04:38,057 --> 00:04:40,049
The answer is in vectorization.

132
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:44,012
In particular, Mini-batch

133
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:45,075
gradient descent is likely to

134
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:47,018
outperform Stochastic gradient descent

135
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,004
only if you have a good vectorized

136
00:04:49,073 --> 00:04:49,073
implementation.

137
00:04:51,002 --> 00:04:53,072
In that case, the sum over

138
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:55,095
10 examples can be

139
00:04:56,007 --> 00:04:58,037
performed in a more vectorized way

140
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:00,050
which will allow you to

141
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:04,068
partially parallelize your computation over the ten examples.

142
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:06,099
So, in other words, by using

143
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:08,075
appropriate vectorization to compute

144
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:10,036
the rest of the terms, you can

145
00:05:10,055 --> 00:05:12,062
sometimes partially use the

146
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,051
good numerical algebra libraries and

147
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:16,060
parallelize your gradient computations

148
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:19,032
over the b examples, whereas if

149
00:05:19,082 --> 00:05:20,063
you were looking at just a

150
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:22,027
single example of time with Stochastic

151
00:05:22,082 --> 00:05:24,012
gradient descent then you know

152
00:05:24,052 --> 00:05:27,006
just looking at one example at a time their isn't much to parallelize over.

153
00:05:27,018 --> 00:05:28,054
At least there is less to parallelize over.

154
00:05:29,082 --> 00:05:31,032
One disadvantage of Mini-batch

155
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:32,099
gradient descent is that there is now

156
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:34,087
this extra parameter b, the

157
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,031
Mini-batch size which you

158
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,079
may have to fiddle with, and which may therefore take time.

159
00:05:39,045 --> 00:05:40,060
But if you have a good

160
00:05:40,068 --> 00:05:42,010
vectorized implementation this can

161
00:05:42,027 --> 00:05:45,013
sometimes run even faster that Stochastic gradient descent.

162
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,067
So that was Mini-batch

163
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,024
gradient descent which is an

164
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:51,050
algorithm that in some sense

165
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,048
does something that's somewhat in

166
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:55,042
between what Stochastic gradient descent does and what Batch gradient descent does.

167
00:05:56,087 --> 00:05:58,057
And if you

168
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:00,062
choose their reasonable value of b. I usually

169
00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:02,051
use b equals 10, but,

170
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:04,051
you know, other values, anywhere from

171
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:06,095
say 2 to 100, would be reasonably common.

172
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:08,093
So we choose value of

173
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:09,086
b and if you use

174
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,018
a good vectorized implementation, sometimes t

175
00:06:12,043 --> 00:06:13,088
can be faster than both Stochastic

176
00:06:14,058 --> 00:06:17,000
gradient descent and faster than Batch gradient descent.
