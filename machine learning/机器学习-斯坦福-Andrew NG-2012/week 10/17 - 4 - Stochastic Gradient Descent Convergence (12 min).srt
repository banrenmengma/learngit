1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:03,006
You now know about the stochastic gradient descent algorithm.

2
00:00:03,097 --> 00:00:05,020
But when you're running the algorithm,

3
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:06,038
how do you make sure that

4
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:09,033
it's completely debugged and is converging okay?

5
00:00:10,065 --> 00:00:12,014
Equally important, how do

6
00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:13,075
you tune the learning rate alpha

7
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:15,053
with Stochastic Gradient Descent.

8
00:00:16,025 --> 00:00:17,039
In this video we talk about

9
00:00:18,048 --> 00:00:19,035
some techniques for doing these things,

10
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:21,039
for making sure it's converging and

11
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,091
for picking the learning

12
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,019
rate alpha.

13
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:27,055
Back when we were using batch

14
00:00:27,096 --> 00:00:29,044
gradient descent our standard way

15
00:00:29,069 --> 00:00:31,001
for making sure that when the

16
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:32,040
set was converging was we

17
00:00:32,052 --> 00:00:34,014
would plot the authorization cost

18
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,085
function as a function of the number of iterations.

19
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:38,078
So that was the cost function

20
00:00:39,043 --> 00:00:40,074
and we would make sure that

21
00:00:41,025 --> 00:00:43,079
this cost function is decreasing on every iteration.

22
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:45,099
When the training set sizes were

23
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:47,035
small we could do that because

24
00:00:47,077 --> 00:00:49,050
we could compute the sum pretty

25
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:51,025
efficiently when you have

26
00:00:51,064 --> 00:00:53,006
a massive training set size

27
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:55,018
then you don't want to have

28
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:56,082
to pause your algorithm periodically.

29
00:00:58,007 --> 00:00:59,028
You don't want to have to stochastic

30
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,003
gradient descent periodically in order

31
00:01:02,043 --> 00:01:03,071
to compute this cost function

32
00:01:04,026 --> 00:01:07,009
since it requires a sum of your entire training set size.

33
00:01:07,098 --> 00:01:09,006
And the whole point of stochastic

34
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:10,081
gradient was that you

35
00:01:10,089 --> 00:01:13,026
wanted to start [XX] after

36
00:01:13,042 --> 00:01:14,093
just looking at a single example without

37
00:01:15,023 --> 00:01:17,032
needing to occasionally scan through

38
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:19,050
your entire training set right

39
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,070
in the middle of the algorithm

40
00:01:21,046 --> 00:01:23,012
just to confuse things like the

41
00:01:23,028 --> 00:01:26,070
cost function of the

42
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:30,029
entire training set converging,

43
00:01:31,034 --> 00:01:32,006
here's what we can do instead.

44
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:35,048
Let's take the definition of the cost that we had previously.

45
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:36,079
So the cost of the parameters

46
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,039
theta with respect to a

47
00:01:38,059 --> 00:01:40,001
single training example is just

48
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:42,039
one half of the square error on that training example.

49
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:45,043
Then, while stochastic gradient descent

50
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,017
is learning, right before

51
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:49,028
we we train on a specific example.

52
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:51,006
So, in stochastic gradient descent

53
00:01:51,034 --> 00:01:52,034
we're going to look at the examples

54
00:01:52,084 --> 00:01:54,037
xi, yi, in order, and

55
00:01:54,054 --> 00:01:56,085
then sort of take a little update with respect to this example.

56
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:58,056
And we go on to the next

57
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,073
example, xi plus 1,

58
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:03,084
yi plus 1, and so on, right?

59
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,053
That's what stochastic gradient descent does.

60
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:07,076
So, while the algorithm

61
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:09,090
is looking at the example

62
00:02:10,024 --> 00:02:11,081
xi, yi, but before

63
00:02:13,015 --> 00:02:14,034
it has updated the parameters

64
00:02:14,088 --> 00:02:17,006
theta using that um, example,

65
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:19,078
let's compute the cost of that example.

66
00:02:20,093 --> 00:02:23,028
Just to say the same thing again, but using slightly different words.

67
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:25,084
stochastic gradient descent is

68
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:27,043
scanning through our training set

69
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:29,078
right before we have updated

70
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,055
theta using a specific training

71
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,075
example x i comma y

72
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,080
i let's compute how well

73
00:02:35,034 --> 00:02:38,058
our hypothesis is doing on that training example.

74
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,093
And we want to do this before updating

75
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:41,066
theta because if we've

76
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,058
just updated theta using example,

77
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:45,031
you know, that it might be doing

78
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:47,084
better on that example than what would be representative.

79
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:50,084
Finally, in order to

80
00:02:50,097 --> 00:02:52,037
check for the convergence [xx]  stochastic

81
00:02:52,065 --> 00:02:53,083
gradient descent, what we can

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,025
do is every, say, every

83
00:02:56,038 --> 00:02:57,087
thousand iterations, we can

84
00:02:58,006 --> 00:03:01,021
plot these costs that we've been computing in the previous step.

85
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:03,030
We can plot those costs average

86
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:05,003
over, say, the last thousand

87
00:03:05,037 --> 00:03:07,003
examples processed by the algorithm.

88
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,038
And if you do this, it kind

89
00:03:09,058 --> 00:03:10,050
of gives you a running estimate

90
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:12,044
of how well the algorithm is doing.

91
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,025
on, you know, the last

92
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,062
1000 training examples that your has seen.

93
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:19,084
So, in contrast to computing

94
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,086
which needed to scan through the entire training set.

95
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:26,037
With this other procedure, well, as

96
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:27,071
part of stochastic gradient descent,

97
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,053
it doesn't cost much to compute

98
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:32,065
these costs as well right be updating to parameter theta.

99
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,066
And all we're doing is every thousand

100
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,031
integrations or so, we just

101
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:37,081
average the last 1,000 costs

102
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,003
that we computed and plot that.

103
00:03:41,006 --> 00:03:42,046
And by looking at those

104
00:03:42,058 --> 00:03:44,000
plots, this will allow

105
00:03:44,012 --> 00:03:46,093
us to check if stochastic gradient descent is converging.

106
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:48,087
So here are a few examples

107
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:51,056
of what these plots might look like.

108
00:03:52,062 --> 00:03:53,074
Suppose you have plotted the cost

109
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:55,071
average over the last thousand examples,

110
00:03:56,012 --> 00:03:57,065
because these are averaged over

111
00:03:57,087 --> 00:03:59,024
just a thousand examples they are

112
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:00,034
going to be a little bit noisy

113
00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:01,081
and so, it may not

114
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:03,037
decrease on every single iteration.

115
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:05,038
Then if you get a figure that

116
00:04:05,056 --> 00:04:06,077
looks like this, So the

117
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,028
plot is noisy because it's

118
00:04:08,046 --> 00:04:09,050
average over, you know, just

119
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:11,056
a small subset, say a thousand training examples.

120
00:04:11,088 --> 00:04:13,009
If you get a figure

121
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:14,053
that looks like this, you know

122
00:04:14,075 --> 00:04:15,088
that would be a pretty decent

123
00:04:16,042 --> 00:04:17,068
run with the algorithm, maybe, where

124
00:04:17,097 --> 00:04:19,031
it looks like the cost has

125
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,072
gone down and then this

126
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:21,098
plateau that looks kind of

127
00:04:22,025 --> 00:04:23,087
flattened out, you know, starting from around there.

128
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:25,073
look like, this is

129
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:28,044
what your cost looks like then maybe your learning algorithm has converged.

130
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:31,061
If you want to try using a

131
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,036
smaller learning rate, something you

132
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:34,082
might see is that the

133
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,061
algorithm may initially learn more

134
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:39,002
slowly so the cost goes down more slowly.

135
00:04:40,006 --> 00:04:41,041
But then eventually you have a

136
00:04:41,056 --> 00:04:42,057
smaller learning rate is actually possible

137
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:44,092
for the algorithm to end up

138
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:47,006
at a, maybe very slightly better solution.

139
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,087
So the red line may represent

140
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,073
the behavior of stochastic gradient descent

141
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:52,042
using a slower, using a

142
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:54,045
smaller And the

143
00:04:54,068 --> 00:04:55,075
reason this is the case is

144
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:57,087
because, you remember, stochastic gradient

145
00:04:58,018 --> 00:04:59,064
descent doesn't just converge

146
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,017
the global minimum, is that

147
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,022
what it does is the parameters

148
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,082
will oscillate a bit around the global minimum.

149
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:06,069
So by using a smaller learning

150
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,061
rate, you'll end up with smaller oscillations.

151
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,018
And Sometimes this little

152
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,038
difference will be negligible

153
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,094
and sometimes with a smaller

154
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:16,018
than you can get a slightly

155
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:19,001
better value for the parameters.

156
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:21,031
Here are some other things that might happen.

157
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,019
Let's say you run stochastic gradient

158
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:24,050
descent and you average over a

159
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:26,098
thousand examples when plotting these costs.

160
00:05:28,044 --> 00:05:29,045
So, you know, here might be

161
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:32,020
the result of averaging another one of these plots.

162
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:35,048
Then again, it kind of looks like it's converged.

163
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,076
If you were to take this number,

164
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:39,006
a thousand, and increase to

165
00:05:39,058 --> 00:05:41,063
averaging over 5 thousand examples.

166
00:05:42,064 --> 00:05:43,088
Then it's possible that you might

167
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:47,067
get a smoother curve that looks more like this.

168
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,077
And by averaging over, say

169
00:05:50,097 --> 00:05:53,010
5,000 examples instead of

170
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:54,060
1,000, you might be able

171
00:05:54,075 --> 00:05:57,012
to get a smoother curve like this.

172
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,007
And so that's the effect of increasing the number of examples you have is your over.

173
00:06:00,074 --> 00:06:01,087
The disadvantage of making this

174
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:03,004
too big of course is that

175
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:05,049
now you get one date point only every 5,000 examples.

176
00:06:06,087 --> 00:06:08,000
And so the feedback you get

177
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:09,012
on how well your learning learning

178
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,032
algorithm is doing is, sort of,

179
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:12,023
maybe it's more delayed because you

180
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:13,075
get one data point on

181
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,070
your plot only every 5,000 examples rather than every 1,000 examples.

182
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:19,094
Along a similar vein some

183
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,062
times you may run a

184
00:06:21,074 --> 00:06:23,083
gradient descent and end up with a plot that looks like this.

185
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:25,087
And with a plot that looks

186
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:28,023
like this, you know, it

187
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:30,029
looks like the cost just

188
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:31,087
is not decreasing at all.

189
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:33,072
It looks like the algorithm is just not learning.

190
00:06:34,049 --> 00:06:35,045
It's just, looks like things

191
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:36,075
get flat, basically a flat curve and the cost is

192
00:06:36,088 --> 00:06:38,008


193
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:40,037
just not decreasing but, again

194
00:06:41,008 --> 00:06:42,056
if you were to increase this

195
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:44,087
to averaging over a larger

196
00:06:45,023 --> 00:06:46,072
number of examples it is possible

197
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:48,075
that you see something like this

198
00:06:49,012 --> 00:06:50,019
it looks like the cost

199
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:52,008
actually is decreasing, it's just

200
00:06:52,031 --> 00:06:53,069
that the blue line averaging

201
00:06:54,007 --> 00:06:55,080
over 2, 3 examples, the

202
00:06:55,094 --> 00:06:57,017
blue line was too noisy so

203
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,056
you couldn't see the actual trend

204
00:06:59,047 --> 00:07:01,094
in the cost actually decreasing

205
00:07:02,036 --> 00:07:04,005
and possibly averaging over 5,000

206
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:05,092
examples instead of 1,000 may help.

207
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:08,037
Of course we averaged over a

208
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:10,024
larger number examples that we've

209
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,087
averaged here over 5,000

210
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,025
examples, I'm just using a different

211
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:14,075
color, it is also possible that you

212
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:16,082
that see a learning curve ends up looking like this.

213
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,058
That it's still fat even

214
00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:20,058
when you average over a larger number of examples.

215
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:23,005
And as you get that, then

216
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,054
that's maybe just a more

217
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,013
firm verification that unfortunately

218
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:28,094
the algorithm just isn't learning much for whatever reason.

219
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,092
And you need to

220
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:32,048
either change the learning rate or

221
00:07:32,054 --> 00:07:34,062
change the features or change something else about the algorithm.

222
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,049
Finally, one last thing that

223
00:07:36,061 --> 00:07:37,054
you might see would be if

224
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:39,012
you were to plot these and

225
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:40,094
you see a curve that looks like

226
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,062
this, where it actually looks like it's increasing.

227
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,038
And if that's the case then this

228
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:47,052
is a sign that the algorithm is diverging.

229
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:49,062
And What you really should

230
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:51,029
do is use a smaller

231
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,067
value of the learning rate alpha.

232
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,011
So hopefully this gives you

233
00:07:56,024 --> 00:07:57,012
a sense of the range of

234
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,036
phenomena you might see when

235
00:07:58,051 --> 00:08:00,012
you plot these cost average over

236
00:08:00,086 --> 00:08:02,055
some range of examples as well

237
00:08:02,093 --> 00:08:04,051
as suggests the sorts

238
00:08:04,064 --> 00:08:05,048
of things you might try to do

239
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:08,037
in response to seeing different plots.

240
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:09,051
So if the plots looks too noisy,

241
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:10,098
or if it wiggles up and

242
00:08:11,008 --> 00:08:12,062
down too much, then try

243
00:08:12,095 --> 00:08:14,060
increasing the number of

244
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:16,000
examples you're averaging over so

245
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:18,035
you can see the overall trend in the plot better.

246
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:20,039
And if you see that

247
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:22,037
the errors are actually increasing, the

248
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:24,004
costs are actually increasing, try

249
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:25,081
using a smaller value of alpha.

250
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:28,055
Finally, it's worth examining the

251
00:08:29,012 --> 00:08:31,006
of the learning rate just a little bit more.

252
00:08:32,026 --> 00:08:33,026
We saw that when we run stochastic

253
00:08:33,088 --> 00:08:35,070
gradient descent, the algorithm will

254
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,008
start here and sort of

255
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:39,012
meander towards the minimum And

256
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:41,012
then it won't really converge, and

257
00:08:41,028 --> 00:08:42,092
instead it'll wander around the minimum forever.

258
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:44,084
And so you end up with

259
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:46,016
a parameter value that is

260
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:47,012
hopefully close to the global

261
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:49,064
minimum that won't be exact at the global minimum.

262
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:53,020
In most typical implementations of stochastic

263
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:55,050
gradient descent the learning rate

264
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:57,050
alpha is typically held constant.

265
00:08:58,028 --> 00:08:59,040
And so what you we end

266
00:08:59,076 --> 00:09:01,029
up is exactly a picture

267
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,092
like this.

268
00:09:03,016 --> 00:09:04,064
If you want stochastic gradient descent

269
00:09:04,082 --> 00:09:05,087
to actually converge to the

270
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:07,044
global minimum, there's one thing

271
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:09,000
which you can do which is

272
00:09:09,012 --> 00:09:11,097
You can slowly decrease the learning rate alpha over time.

273
00:09:12,095 --> 00:09:14,048
So, a pretty typical way

274
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:16,010
of doing that would be

275
00:09:16,037 --> 00:09:18,055
to set alpha equals some

276
00:09:18,086 --> 00:09:20,007
constant one divided by iteration

277
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:22,058
number plus constant 2.

278
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:24,004
So, iteration number is the

279
00:09:24,016 --> 00:09:25,035
number of iterations you've run

280
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:27,000
of stochastic gradient descent,

281
00:09:27,012 --> 00:09:28,012
so it's really the number of

282
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:30,000
training examples you've And counts

283
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:31,090
1 and counts 2 are

284
00:09:32,025 --> 00:09:33,062
additional parameters that you have

285
00:09:34,002 --> 00:09:34,078
that you might have to play

286
00:09:35,005 --> 00:09:37,055
with a bit in order to get good performance.

287
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,039
reasons people tend not to

288
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:41,074
do this is because you end

289
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:43,001
up needing to spend time playing

290
00:09:43,036 --> 00:09:44,073
with these 2 extra parameters, constant

291
00:09:45,024 --> 00:09:47,064
1 and constant 2, and so this makes the algorithm more finicky.

292
00:09:48,008 --> 00:09:49,012
You know, it's just more parameters able

293
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:51,088
to fiddle with in order to make the algorithm work well.

294
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:53,078
But if you manage to tune

295
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:56,004
the parameters well, then the

296
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,030
picture you can get is that

297
00:09:57,057 --> 00:10:00,094
the algorithm will actually around towards

298
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:02,020
the minimum, but as it gets

299
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,007
closer because you're decreasing the

300
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:06,000
learning rate the meanderings will

301
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:07,062
get smaller and smaller until

302
00:10:07,092 --> 00:10:10,005
it pretty much just to the global minimum.

303
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,062
I hope this makes sense, right?

304
00:10:13,011 --> 00:10:14,040
And the reason this formula makes

305
00:10:14,062 --> 00:10:15,072
sense is because as the

306
00:10:15,088 --> 00:10:18,014
algorithm runs, the iteration number becomes

307
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:20,037
large So alpha will slowly

308
00:10:20,088 --> 00:10:22,030
become small, and so

309
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,067
you take smaller and smaller steps

310
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,037
until it sort of, you

311
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,000
know, hopefully converges to the global minimum.

312
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:30,015
So If you do slowly decrease

313
00:10:30,058 --> 00:10:32,097
alpha to zero you can end up with a slightly better hypothesis.

314
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:35,035
But because of the extra work

315
00:10:35,075 --> 00:10:38,091
needed for the constants and because frankly you.

316
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:40,078
we're pretty happy with any

317
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,048
parameter value that is, you know, pretty close to the global minimum.

318
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:45,065
Typically this process of decreasing

319
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:48,004
alpha slowly is usually not

320
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:49,094
done and Keeping the learning.

321
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:51,064
Alpha constant is the more

322
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,066
common application of stochastic

323
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,063
gradient descent although you will see people use either version.

324
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,055
To summarize in this video

325
00:11:00,096 --> 00:11:02,013
we talk about a way for

326
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:04,039
approximately monitoring how the

327
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:05,083
stochastic gradient descent is doing

328
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,000
in terms for optimizing the cost function.

329
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,087
And this is a method that

330
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:12,005
does not require scanning over

331
00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:13,054
the entire training set periodically

332
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:15,048
to compute the cost function.

333
00:11:16,044 --> 00:11:18,012
But instead it looks

334
00:11:18,034 --> 00:11:19,040
at say only the last thousand

335
00:11:21,002 --> 00:11:21,074
examples or so.

336
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,040
And you can use this method both

337
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:25,009
to make sure the stochastic gradient

338
00:11:25,033 --> 00:11:26,098
descent is okay and is converging

339
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:30,062
or to use it to tune the learning rate alpha.
