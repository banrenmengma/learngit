1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,081
In the next few videos, we'll talk about large scale machine learning.

2
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:07,051
That is algorithms but viewing with big data sets.

3
00:00:08,043 --> 00:00:09,055
If you look back and a

4
00:00:09,073 --> 00:00:12,015
recent 5 or 10-year history of machine learning.

5
00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:14,009
One of the reasons that learning

6
00:00:14,044 --> 00:00:15,051
albums works so much better

7
00:00:15,077 --> 00:00:16,091
now than even say, 5-years

8
00:00:17,044 --> 00:00:18,057
ago, is just the sheer

9
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:20,016
amount of data that we

10
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:22,025
have now and that we can trade our algorithms on.

11
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:23,073
In these next few videos,

12
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:25,064
we'll talk about algorithms for dealing

13
00:00:25,096 --> 00:00:27,051
when we have such massive

14
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:33,020
data sets. So why

15
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,022
do we want to use such large data sets?

16
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:37,017
We've already seen that one

17
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:38,028
of the best ways to get

18
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,086
a high performance machine learning

19
00:00:40,017 --> 00:00:41,036
system, is if you

20
00:00:41,053 --> 00:00:43,059
take a low-bias learning algorithm, and

21
00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:45,081
train that on a lot of data.

22
00:00:46,063 --> 00:00:47,071
And so, one early

23
00:00:47,095 --> 00:00:49,020
example already seen was

24
00:00:49,047 --> 00:00:53,010
this example of cos sin between confusable words.

25
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,050
So, for breakfast, I ate two

26
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:58,004
eggs and we saw in

27
00:00:58,013 --> 00:00:59,092
this example, these sorts

28
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:02,047
of results, where, you know, so long

29
00:01:02,085 --> 00:01:04,021
as you feed the algorithm a lot

30
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:06,003
of data, it seems to do very well.

31
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,079
And so it's results like these

32
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:08,087
that has led to the saying

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,085
in machine learning that often it's

34
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:12,048
not who has the best algorithm that wins.

35
00:01:12,093 --> 00:01:14,009
It's who has the most data.

36
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:15,098
So you want to learn

37
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,050
from large data sets, at

38
00:01:17,064 --> 00:01:19,015
least when we can get such large data sets.

39
00:01:20,073 --> 00:01:21,096
But learning with large data sets

40
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:23,051
comes with its own unique

41
00:01:23,085 --> 00:01:26,029
problems, specifically, computational problems.

42
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:28,078
Let's say your training set size

43
00:01:31,096 --> 00:01:32,034
is M equals 100,000,000.

44
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:34,095
And this is actually pretty

45
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:37,046
realistic for many modern data sets.

46
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:38,081
If you look at the US Census

47
00:01:39,026 --> 00:01:40,071
data set, if there

48
00:01:40,076 --> 00:01:41,095
are, you know, 300 million people in the

49
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:44,018
US, you can usually get hundreds of millions of records.

50
00:01:44,068 --> 00:01:45,070
If you look at the amount of

51
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:47,084
traffic that popular websites get, you

52
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,078
easily get training sets that are much larger than hundreds of millions of examples.

53
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,054
And let's say you want

54
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,043
to train a linear regression model

55
00:01:55,089 --> 00:01:57,007
or maybe a logistic regression model,

56
00:01:58,023 --> 00:02:01,090
in which case this is the gradient descent rule.

57
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,020
And if you look at what

58
00:02:03,037 --> 00:02:04,018
you need to do to compute

59
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:05,079
the gradient, which is this

60
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,075
term over here, then when

61
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:09,013
M is a hundred million,

62
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:11,025
you need to carry out a summation

63
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,019
over a hundred million terms,

64
00:02:14,027 --> 00:02:15,072
in order to compute these derivatives

65
00:02:16,028 --> 00:02:18,038
terms and to perform a single step of decent.

66
00:02:20,018 --> 00:02:22,028
Because of the computational expense of

67
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:24,009
summing over a hundred million

68
00:02:24,096 --> 00:02:26,003
entries in order to

69
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,058
compute just one step of

70
00:02:27,071 --> 00:02:29,012
gradient descent, in the next

71
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,075
few videos we've spoken about techniques

72
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,078
for either replacing this with

73
00:02:33,018 --> 00:02:34,047
something else or to

74
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:36,087
find more efficient ways to compute this derivative.

75
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,027
By the end of this sequence

76
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:41,000
of videos on large scale machine

77
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:42,046
learning, you know how

78
00:02:42,074 --> 00:02:47,015
to fit models, linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks and so on even

79
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:49,037
two data sets with, say, a hundred million examples.

80
00:02:50,012 --> 00:02:51,081
Of course, before we

81
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:53,034
put in the effort into training

82
00:02:53,096 --> 00:02:55,006
a model with a hundred million

83
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,053
examples, We should also ask

84
00:02:56,081 --> 00:02:57,093
ourselves, well, why not

85
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,047
use just a thousand examples.

86
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:02,096
Maybe we can randomly pick the

87
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:04,037
subsets of a thousand examples

88
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,087
out of a hundred million

89
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,094
examples and train our algorithm

90
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:09,046
on just a thousand examples.

91
00:03:10,058 --> 00:03:11,099
So before investing the effort

92
00:03:12,028 --> 00:03:14,002
into actually developing and

93
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:15,024
the software needed to train these

94
00:03:15,043 --> 00:03:16,068
massive models is often a

95
00:03:16,086 --> 00:03:18,033
good sanity check, if

96
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:20,027
training on just a thousand

97
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:22,012
examples might do just as well.

98
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,015
The way to sanity check of

99
00:03:26,022 --> 00:03:28,000
using a much smaller training

100
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:29,040
set might do just as

101
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:30,078
well, that is if using

102
00:03:31,012 --> 00:03:33,015
a much smaller n equals 1000 size

103
00:03:33,037 --> 00:03:34,025
training set, that might do just

104
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:35,050
as well, it is the usual

105
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:37,006
method of plotting the learning

106
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,071
curves, so if you

107
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,083
were to plot the learning

108
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:43,031
curves and if your training

109
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:45,091
objective were to look

110
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,058
like this, that's J train theta.

111
00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:52,022
And if your cross-validation set

112
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,005
objective, Jcv of theta

113
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:56,075
would look like this, then this

114
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,069
looks like a high-variance learning

115
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,066
algorithm, and we will

116
00:04:00,084 --> 00:04:02,033
be more confident that adding

117
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:05,034
extra training examples would improve performance.

118
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:07,062
Whereas in contrast if you

119
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:09,006
were to plot the learning

120
00:04:09,037 --> 00:04:12,043
curves, if your training

121
00:04:12,097 --> 00:04:14,003
objective were to look like

122
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:15,043
this, and if your

123
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,044
trans-validation objective were to

124
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,081
look like that, then this looks

125
00:04:21,006 --> 00:04:23,061
like the classical high-bias learning algorithm.

126
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:25,069
And in the latter case, you know, if

127
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:27,097
you were to plot this up to,

128
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:29,037
say, m equals 1000 and so

129
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:31,031
that is m equals 500 up

130
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,072
to m equals 1000, then it

131
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,094
seems unlikely that increasing m

132
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:38,050
to a hundred million will

133
00:04:38,092 --> 00:04:40,007
do much better and then you'd

134
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:42,006
be just fine sticking to n equals 1000,

135
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:43,070
rather than investing a lot

136
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:45,095
of effort to figure out how the scale of the algorithm.

137
00:04:46,094 --> 00:04:48,007
Of course, if you were in

138
00:04:48,023 --> 00:04:49,098
the situation shown by the

139
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:50,083
figure on the right, then one

140
00:04:50,093 --> 00:04:51,079
natural thing to do would

141
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,043
be to add extra features,

142
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:55,080
or add extra hidden units

143
00:04:56,017 --> 00:04:57,069
to your neural network and

144
00:04:57,081 --> 00:04:58,098
so on, so that you

145
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,029
end up with a situation

146
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:02,066
closer to that on the

147
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:03,047
left, where maybe this is up to

148
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:05,012
n equals 1000, and this then

149
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:06,062
gives you more confidence that trying

150
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:08,079
to add infrastructure to

151
00:05:08,095 --> 00:05:09,072
change the algorithm to use

152
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:11,025
much more than a thousand examples

153
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:13,085
that might actually be a good use of your time.

154
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,098
So in large-scale machine learning,

155
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:17,079
we like to come up with

156
00:05:17,094 --> 00:05:19,070
computationally reasonable ways, or

157
00:05:20,031 --> 00:05:23,037
computationally efficient ways, to deal with very big data sets.

158
00:05:24,012 --> 00:05:26,014
In the next few videos, we'll see two main ideas.

159
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:28,010
The first is called cost and

160
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:29,068
gradient descent and the second

161
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:32,087
is called Map Reduce, for viewing with very big data sets.

162
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:35,014
And after you've learned about

163
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,082
these methods, hopefully that will

164
00:05:36,098 --> 00:05:38,026
allow you to scale up your

165
00:05:38,043 --> 00:05:39,063
learning algorithms to big data

166
00:05:40,036 --> 00:05:41,043
and allow you to get much

167
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:44,000
better performance on many different applications.
