1
00:00:00,054 --> 00:00:02,029
For many learning algorithms, among them

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,050
linear regression, logistic regression and

3
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:06,012
neural networks, the way we

4
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:09,007
derive the algorithm was by coming up with a cost function or

5
00:00:09,081 --> 00:00:11,015
coming up with an optimization objective.

6
00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:13,060
And then using an algorithm like

7
00:00:13,083 --> 00:00:15,071
gradient descent to minimize that cost function.

8
00:00:16,078 --> 00:00:17,083
We have a very large training

9
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:19,062
set gradient descent becomes

10
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,080
a computationally very expensive procedure.

11
00:00:22,092 --> 00:00:24,000
In this video, we'll talk about

12
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:25,060
a modification to the basic

13
00:00:26,012 --> 00:00:27,098
gradient descent algorithm called Stochastic

14
00:00:28,058 --> 00:00:29,076
gradient descent, which will

15
00:00:29,098 --> 00:00:30,094
allow us to scale these

16
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:38,010
algorithms to much bigger training sets. Suppose you

17
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:40,079
are training a linear regression model using gradient descent.

18
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:43,079
As a quick recap, the hypothesis

19
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:45,067
will look like this, and

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,039
the cost function will look

21
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:48,042
like this, which is the sum

22
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:49,082
of one half of the

23
00:00:50,024 --> 00:00:52,006
average square error of your

24
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:53,071
hypothesis on your m training examples,

25
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:56,042
and the cost function we've

26
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,090
already seen looks like this sort of bow-shaped function.

27
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:04,004
So, plotted as function of the parameters theta 0 and theta 1, the cost function J

28
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:05,078
is a sort of a bow-shaped function.

29
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:08,051
And gradient descent looks like

30
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,098
this, where in the inner

31
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,057
loop of gradient descent you repeatedly

32
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,060
update the parameters theta using that expression.

33
00:01:16,048 --> 00:01:17,067
Now in the rest of

34
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:18,079
this video, I'm going to

35
00:01:18,089 --> 00:01:21,084
keep using linear regression as the running example.

36
00:01:22,073 --> 00:01:24,015
But the ideas here, the ideas

37
00:01:24,057 --> 00:01:25,068
of Stochastic gradient descent is

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,026
fully general and also

39
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:28,085
applies to other learning algorithms

40
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:31,068
like logistic regression, neural networks and other

41
00:01:31,098 --> 00:01:33,023
algorithms that are based

42
00:01:34,004 --> 00:01:35,029
on training gradient descent on

43
00:01:35,057 --> 00:01:37,009
a specific training set.

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,014
So here's a picture of what gradient descent does, if

45
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:49,037
the parameters are initialized to the point there then as you run gradient descent different iterations of gradient descent will take the parameters to the global minimum.

46
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,031
So take a trajectory that looks

47
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,079
like that and heads pretty directly

48
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:54,031
to the global minimum.

49
00:01:55,062 --> 00:01:56,090
Now, the problem with gradient descent

50
00:01:57,093 --> 00:01:59,026
is that if m is large.

51
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:01,089
Then computing this derivative

52
00:02:02,043 --> 00:02:03,090
term can be very

53
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:05,054
expensive, because the surprise,

54
00:02:05,095 --> 00:02:07,051
summing over all m examples.

55
00:02:08,058 --> 00:02:09,075
So if m is 300

56
00:02:10,044 --> 00:02:13,038
million, alright. So

57
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,028
in the United States, there are about 300 million people.

58
00:02:15,072 --> 00:02:16,087
And so the US or United

59
00:02:17,025 --> 00:02:18,066
States census data may have

60
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:20,027
on the order of that many records.

61
00:02:20,087 --> 00:02:21,077
So you want to fit the linear

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,009
regression model to that then you need to sum over 300 million records.

63
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:27,030
And that's very expensive.

64
00:02:28,058 --> 00:02:29,062
To give the algorithm a name,

65
00:02:29,088 --> 00:02:31,028
this particular version of gradient

66
00:02:31,065 --> 00:02:35,028
descent is also called Batch gradient descent.

67
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:38,030
And the term Batch refers to

68
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:39,037
the fact that we're looking at

69
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,027
all of the training examples at a time.

70
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:43,075
We call it sort of a batch of all of the training examples.

71
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,069
And it really isn't the, maybe

72
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:47,043
the best name but this is

73
00:02:47,078 --> 00:02:49,037
what machine learning people call

74
00:02:49,063 --> 00:02:52,009
this particular version of gradient descent.

75
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,097
And if you imagine really that

76
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:56,087
you have 300 million census records stored away on disc.

77
00:02:57,072 --> 00:02:59,005
The way this algorithm works is

78
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,040
you need to read into

79
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:02,034
your computer memory all 300

80
00:03:02,084 --> 00:03:05,046
million records in order to compute this derivative term.

81
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,093
You need to stream all of

82
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:08,096
these records through computer because

83
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:12,022
you can't store all your records in computer memory.

84
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:15,058
So you need to read through them and slowly, you know, accumulate the sum in order to compute the derivative.

85
00:03:16,078 --> 00:03:17,072
And then having done all that

86
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:19,034
work, that allows you

87
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,006
to take one step of gradient descent.

88
00:03:21,088 --> 00:03:24,015
And now you need to do the whole thing again.

89
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:25,062
You know, scan through all 300

90
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,090
million records, accumulate these sums.

91
00:03:28,087 --> 00:03:29,071
And having done all that work,

92
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:32,018
you can take another little step using gradient descent.

93
00:03:32,034 --> 00:03:33,030
And then do that again.

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,009
And then you take yet a third step.

95
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,036
And so on.

96
00:03:36,038 --> 00:03:37,040
And so it's gonna take

97
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:39,006
a long time in order to

98
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:40,075
get the algorithm to converge. In contrast

99
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,090
to Batch gradient descent, what we

100
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,009
are going to do is come up

101
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:45,087
with a different algorithm that doesn't

102
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:47,034
need to look at all the

103
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,016
training examples in every

104
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,093
single iteration, but that needs

105
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:52,003
to look at only a single

106
00:03:52,053 --> 00:03:54,009
training example in one iteration.

107
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:55,083
Before moving on to the

108
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:57,062
new algorithm, here's just a

109
00:03:57,075 --> 00:03:58,081
Batch gradient descent algorithm written out

110
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,072
again with that being

111
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:02,028
the cost function and that being

112
00:04:02,046 --> 00:04:03,090
the update and of

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,056
course this term here, that's

114
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:09,018
used in the gradient descent rule, that

115
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:11,037
is the partial derivative with respect

116
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:13,071
to the parameters theta J of

117
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:16,075
our optimization objective, J train of theta.

118
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,037
Now, let's look at the more

119
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:20,089
efficient algorithm that scales better

120
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:22,085
to large data sets.

121
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,037
In order to work off the

122
00:04:24,048 --> 00:04:26,091
algorithms called Stochastic gradient descent,

123
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:29,019
this vectors the cost function in a slightly different way then they

124
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:31,058
define the cost of the parameter theta

125
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,000
with respect to a

126
00:04:34,057 --> 00:04:35,072
training example x(i), y(i) to be equal

127
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:39,010
to one half times

128
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:40,066
the squared error that my

129
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:43,022
hypothesis incurs on that example, x(i), y(i).

130
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:46,023
So this cost function term really

131
00:04:46,043 --> 00:04:47,077
measures how well is

132
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:51,032
my hypothesis doing on a single example x(i), y(i).

133
00:04:53,032 --> 00:04:54,089
Now you notice that the

134
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:58,007
overall cost function j train can now

135
00:04:58,036 --> 00:05:00,047
be written in this equivalent form.

136
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:02,036
So j train is just

137
00:05:02,076 --> 00:05:04,000
the average over my m

138
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:05,081
training examples of the cost

139
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:07,091
of my hypothesis on that

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,025
example x(i), y(i). Armed

141
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,069
with this view of the cost

142
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:13,086
function for linear regression, let

143
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:16,080
me now write out what Stochastic gradient descent does.

144
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:20,049
The first step of Stochastic gradient

145
00:05:20,082 --> 00:05:22,067
descent is to randomly

146
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:26,035
shuffle the data set.

147
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,075
So by that I just mean

148
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:29,080
randomly shuffle, or randomly

149
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:32,052
reorder your m training examples.

150
00:05:33,022 --> 00:05:36,044
It's sort of a standard pre-processing step, come back to this in a minute.

151
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:39,007
But the main work of

152
00:05:39,018 --> 00:05:41,079
Stochastic gradient descent is then done in the following.

153
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:45,043
We're going to repeat for i equals 1

154
00:05:45,073 --> 00:05:48,043
through m. So we'll repeatedly scan

155
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:52,056
through my training examples and perform the following update.

156
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:54,010
Gonna update the parameter theta j

157
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:56,086
as theta j minus alpha

158
00:05:57,062 --> 00:05:59,037
times h of x(i)

159
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:01,088
minus y(i)

160
00:06:03,044 --> 00:06:05,087
times x(i)j.

161
00:06:07,016 --> 00:06:08,025
And we're going to do

162
00:06:08,047 --> 00:06:10,076
this update as usual for all

163
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:13,052
values of j. Now,

164
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:16,007
you notice that this term

165
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:19,026
over here is exactly

166
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,045
what we had inside the

167
00:06:22,052 --> 00:06:23,082
summation for Batch gradient

168
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:25,042
descent.

169
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:26,062
In fact, for those of you that are

170
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:28,019
calculus is possible to

171
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:30,025
show that that term here, that's

172
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:32,000
this term here, is equal

173
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:34,020
to the partial derivative with

174
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:35,072
respect to my parameter theta

175
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,093
j of the cost of the

176
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:41,010
parameters theta on x(i),

177
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:43,051
y(i). Where

178
00:06:43,068 --> 00:06:46,013
cost is of course this thing that was defined previously.

179
00:06:47,076 --> 00:06:49,000
And just the wrap of

180
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:50,001
the algorithm, let me close

181
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,068
my curly braces over there.

182
00:06:53,022 --> 00:06:54,074
So what Stochastic gradient

183
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:56,081
descent is doing is it is actually

184
00:06:57,055 --> 00:06:58,081
scanning through the training examples.

185
00:06:59,076 --> 00:07:00,085
And first it's gonna look at

186
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:03,026
my first training example x(1), y(1).

187
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:05,020
And then looking at

188
00:07:05,054 --> 00:07:07,031
only this first example, it's

189
00:07:07,058 --> 00:07:09,082
gonna take like a basically a little gradient descent step with

190
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,007
respect to the cost

191
00:07:11,074 --> 00:07:13,018
of just this first training example.

192
00:07:13,051 --> 00:07:14,018
So in other words, we're going to

193
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:15,027
look at the first example

194
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:17,044
and modify the parameters

195
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:18,093
a little bit to fit

196
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:20,081
just the first training example a little bit better.

197
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,069
Having done this inside this

198
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:25,043
inner for-loop is then

199
00:07:25,062 --> 00:07:27,080
going to go on to the second training example.

200
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:30,007
And what it's going to do

201
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:31,094
there is take another

202
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:33,045
little step in parameter space,

203
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:35,039
so modify the parameters just

204
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:36,075
a little bit to try to

205
00:07:36,092 --> 00:07:38,087
fit just a second training example a little bit better.

206
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:41,048
Having done that, is then

207
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:43,039
going to go onto my third training example.

208
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:47,005
And modify the parameters

209
00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:48,041
to try to fit just

210
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,002
the third training example a little

211
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:51,049
bit better, and so on

212
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:53,017
until you know, you get through the entire training set.

213
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,068
And then this ultra repeat loop

214
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:58,038
may cause it to take

215
00:07:58,066 --> 00:08:00,030
multiple passes over the entire training set.

216
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,087
This view of Stochastic gradient descent

217
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:04,073
also motivates why we wanted

218
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,069
to start by randomly shuffling the

219
00:08:06,076 --> 00:08:08,011
data set. This doesn't show

220
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:09,067
us that when we scan through the

221
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:11,002
training site here, that we

222
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:12,010
end up visiting the training

223
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:14,063
examples in some sort of randomly sorted order.

224
00:08:15,054 --> 00:08:16,082
Depending on whether your data

225
00:08:17,004 --> 00:08:18,070
already came randomly sorted or whether

226
00:08:18,088 --> 00:08:20,020
it came originally sorted in

227
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:21,073
some strange order, in practice

228
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,082
this would just speed up the conversions

229
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:26,020
to Stochastic gradient descent just a little bit.

230
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:27,035
So in the interest of safety,

231
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,002
it's usually better to randomly shuffle

232
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:30,044
the data set if you aren't

233
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:32,062
sure if it came to you in randomly sorted order.

234
00:08:33,088 --> 00:08:35,044
But more importantly another view

235
00:08:35,084 --> 00:08:37,062
of Stochastic gradient descent is

236
00:08:37,094 --> 00:08:40,047
that it's a lot like descent but

237
00:08:40,075 --> 00:08:42,037
rather than wait to sum up

238
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,092
these gradient terms over all

239
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:45,086
m training examples, what we're

240
00:08:46,015 --> 00:08:47,072
doing is we're taking this

241
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,017
gradient term using just one

242
00:08:49,049 --> 00:08:50,082
single training example and we're

243
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:52,041
starting to make progress in

244
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,013
improving the parameters already.

245
00:08:54,062 --> 00:08:55,063
So rather than, you know,

246
00:08:55,086 --> 00:08:57,073
waiting 'till taking a path through

247
00:08:58,023 --> 00:09:01,048
all 300,000 United States Census

248
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:03,016
records, say, rather than needing

249
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:04,046
to scan through all of

250
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,088
the training examples before we can

251
00:09:06,035 --> 00:09:07,060
modify the parameters a little

252
00:09:07,074 --> 00:09:09,049
bit and make progress towards a global minimum.

253
00:09:10,074 --> 00:09:12,017
For Stochastic gradient descent instead

254
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:13,062
we just need to look at

255
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,037
a single training example and we're

256
00:09:15,064 --> 00:09:16,095
already starting to make

257
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,008
progress in this case of parameters

258
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:21,066
towards, moving the parameters towards the global minimum.

259
00:09:23,016 --> 00:09:24,034
So, here's the algorithm written

260
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:25,071
out again where the first step

261
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:26,096
is to randomly shuffle the data

262
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:28,075
and the second step is where

263
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:29,099
the real work is done, where

264
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:31,042
that's the update with respect

265
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:33,073
to a single training example x(i), y(i).

266
00:09:35,014 --> 00:09:38,013
So, let's see what

267
00:09:38,046 --> 00:09:39,087
this algorithm does to the parameters.

268
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:41,077
Previously, we saw that when

269
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:43,011
we are using Batch gradient descent,

270
00:09:43,063 --> 00:09:44,077
that is the algorithm that looks

271
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:46,003
at all the training examples in time,

272
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:47,061
Batch gradient descent will tend

273
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:48,091
to, you know, take a reasonably

274
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:51,089
straight line trajectory to get

275
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:53,069
to the global minimum like that.

276
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:56,050
In contrast with Stochastic

277
00:09:57,005 --> 00:09:58,095
gradient descent every iteration is

278
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,050
going to be much faster because we

279
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,045
don't need to sum up over all the training examples.

280
00:10:03,046 --> 00:10:04,077
But every iteration is just

281
00:10:05,002 --> 00:10:06,077
trying to fit single training example better.

282
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:08,084
So, if we were to

283
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,064
start stochastic gradient descent, oh,

284
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,012
let's start stochastic gradient descent at a point like that.

285
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:16,044
The first iteration, you know, may take

286
00:10:16,092 --> 00:10:18,095
the parameters in that direction and

287
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:21,009
maybe the second iteration looking

288
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:22,075
at just the second example maybe

289
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,004
just by chance, we get more unlucky

290
00:10:24,025 --> 00:10:27,023
and actually head in a bad direction with the parameters like that.

291
00:10:27,072 --> 00:10:29,009
In the third iteration

292
00:10:29,073 --> 00:10:31,003
where we tried to modify the

293
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,055
parameters to fit just the third training

294
00:10:32,086 --> 00:10:35,027
examples better, maybe we'll end up heading in that direction.

295
00:10:36,032 --> 00:10:38,035
And then we'll look at the fourth training example and we will do that.

296
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,080
The fifth example, sixth example, 7th

297
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:43,011
and so on.

298
00:10:43,034 --> 00:10:44,072
And as you run Stochastic gradient

299
00:10:45,002 --> 00:10:46,013
descent, what you find

300
00:10:46,053 --> 00:10:48,075
is that it will generally move the parameters

301
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:50,091
in the direction of the global

302
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,057
minimum, but not always.

303
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:56,004
And so take some more

304
00:10:56,028 --> 00:10:59,072
random-looking, circuitous path to watch the global minimum.

305
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:01,080
And in fact as you run

306
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,060
Stochastic gradient descent it doesn't

307
00:11:03,099 --> 00:11:05,025
actually converge in the same

308
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:06,047
same sense as Batch gradient

309
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,013
descent does and what it

310
00:11:08,022 --> 00:11:09,073
ends up doing is wandering around

311
00:11:10,015 --> 00:11:11,082
continuously in some region

312
00:11:12,057 --> 00:11:14,012
that's in some region close to

313
00:11:14,022 --> 00:11:15,029
the global minimum, but it doesn't

314
00:11:15,096 --> 00:11:17,079
just get to the global minimum and stay there.

315
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,020
But in practice this isn't a

316
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:21,035
problem because, you know, so

317
00:11:21,053 --> 00:11:22,089
long as the parameters end up

318
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:24,047
in some region there maybe it is

319
00:11:25,008 --> 00:11:26,012
pretty close to the global minimum.

320
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:28,012
So, as parameters end

321
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:29,020
up pretty close to the global

322
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:30,071
minimum, that will be

323
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,000
a pretty good hypothesis and so

324
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:35,095
usually running Stochastic gradient descent

325
00:11:36,046 --> 00:11:37,088
we get a parameter near the

326
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,028
global minimum and that's good

327
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:40,084
enough for, you know, essentially

328
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,083
any, most practical purposes.

329
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:44,083
Just one final detail.

330
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:46,079
In Stochastic gradient descent, we

331
00:11:46,091 --> 00:11:48,039
had this outer loop repeat which

332
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,012
says to do this inner loop multiple times.

333
00:11:51,037 --> 00:11:53,038
So, how many times do we repeat this outer loop?

334
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,076
Depending on the size of

335
00:11:54,082 --> 00:11:56,045
the training set, doing this

336
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,099
loop just a single time may be enough.

337
00:11:59,037 --> 00:12:00,023
And up to, you know, maybe

338
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:01,044
10 times may be typical

339
00:12:01,075 --> 00:12:03,033
so we may end up repeating this

340
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,050
inner loop anywhere from once to ten times.

341
00:12:06,086 --> 00:12:08,030
So if we have a you know, truly

342
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,090
massive data set like the

343
00:12:10,015 --> 00:12:11,065
this US census gave us that example

344
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:13,027
that I've been talking about with

345
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,045
300 million examples, it is

346
00:12:15,076 --> 00:12:17,000
possible that by the time

347
00:12:17,017 --> 00:12:18,038
you've taken just a single pass

348
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:22,095
through your training set. So, this is for i equals 1 through 300 million.

349
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,002
It's possible that by the time

350
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,025
you've taken a single pass through

351
00:12:25,032 --> 00:12:26,041
your data set you might already

352
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,011
have a perfectly good hypothesis.

353
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:31,026
In which case, you know, this

354
00:12:31,053 --> 00:12:33,015
inner loop you might

355
00:12:33,055 --> 00:12:36,000
need to do only once if m is very, very large.

356
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,071
But in general taking anywhere

357
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:40,010
from 1 through 10 passes

358
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,057
through your data set, you know, maybe fairly common.

359
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:44,011
But really it depends on

360
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:46,062
the size of your training set.

361
00:12:46,088 --> 00:12:48,096
And if you contrast this to Batch gradient descent.

362
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,034
With Batch gradient descent, after taking

363
00:12:51,058 --> 00:12:52,057
a pass through your entire

364
00:12:52,098 --> 00:12:53,080
training set, you would have

365
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:56,064
taken just one single gradient descent steps.

366
00:12:56,098 --> 00:12:58,003
So one of these little baby

367
00:12:58,038 --> 00:12:59,048
steps of gradient descent where

368
00:12:59,075 --> 00:13:01,000
you just take one small

369
00:13:01,038 --> 00:13:03,021
gradient descent step and this

370
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:05,035
is why Stochastic gradient descent can be much faster.

371
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:10,026
So, that was the Stochastic gradient descent algorithm.

372
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:12,086
And if you implement it, hopefully that

373
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:14,021
will allow you to scale up

374
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:15,077
many of your learning algorithms to

375
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,000
much bigger data sets and get

376
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:18,059
much more performance that way.
