1
00:00:00,032 --> 00:00:01,051
In the last few videos, we talked

2
00:00:01,081 --> 00:00:03,043
about stochastic gradient descent, and,

3
00:00:03,062 --> 00:00:05,001
you know, other variations of the

4
00:00:05,012 --> 00:00:06,053
stochastic gradient descent algorithm,

5
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:09,015
including those adaptations to online

6
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:10,041
learning, but all of those

7
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,081
algorithms could be run on

8
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,074
one machine, or could be run on one computer.

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,086
And some machine learning problems

10
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,026
are just too big to run

11
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:19,016
on one machine, sometimes maybe

12
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,005
you just so much data you

13
00:00:21,017 --> 00:00:22,035
just don't ever want to run

14
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:23,098
all that data through a

15
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,026
single computer, no matter what algorithm you would use on that computer.

16
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:29,064
So in this video I'd

17
00:00:29,073 --> 00:00:31,023
like to talk about different approach

18
00:00:31,076 --> 00:00:33,060
to large scale machine learning, called

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,018
the map reduce approach.

20
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,007
And even though we have

21
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,039
quite a few videos on stochastic

22
00:00:39,096 --> 00:00:41,022
gradient descent and we're going

23
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:43,010
to spend relative less time

24
00:00:43,046 --> 00:00:45,035
on map reduce--don't judge the

25
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,075
relative importance of map reduce

26
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:48,024
versus the gradient descent

27
00:00:48,068 --> 00:00:49,059
based on the amount amount of

28
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:51,047
time I spend on these ideas in particular.

29
00:00:52,022 --> 00:00:53,038
Many people will say that

30
00:00:53,078 --> 00:00:54,084
map reduce is at least

31
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:56,032
an equally important, and some

32
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:57,085
would say an even more important idea

33
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,061
compared to gradient descent, only

34
00:01:01,046 --> 00:01:03,003
it's relatively simpler to

35
00:01:03,015 --> 00:01:04,062
explain, which is why I'm

36
00:01:04,071 --> 00:01:05,057
going to spend less time on

37
00:01:05,082 --> 00:01:07,004
it, but using these ideas

38
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,040
you might be able to scale

39
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:10,064
learning algorithms to even

40
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:12,051
far larger problems than is

41
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:14,053
possible using stochastic gradient descent.

42
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:19,000
Here's the idea.

43
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:21,001
Let's say we want to fit

44
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:22,095
a linear regression model or

45
00:01:23,014 --> 00:01:24,043
a logistic regression model or some

46
00:01:24,054 --> 00:01:26,009
such, and let's start again

47
00:01:26,043 --> 00:01:27,065
with batch gradient descent, so

48
00:01:27,084 --> 00:01:30,029
that's our batch gradient descent learning rule.

49
00:01:31,023 --> 00:01:32,043
And to keep the writing

50
00:01:32,084 --> 00:01:34,017
on this slide tractable, I'm going

51
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:36,098
to assume throughout that we have m equals 400 examples.

52
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:39,056
Of course, by our

53
00:01:39,075 --> 00:01:40,084
standards, in terms of large scale

54
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,004
machine learning, you know m

55
00:01:42,017 --> 00:01:43,020
might be pretty small and so,

56
00:01:43,076 --> 00:01:45,039
this might be more commonly

57
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:46,092
applied to problems, where you

58
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:48,018
have maybe closer to 400

59
00:01:48,073 --> 00:01:49,093
million examples, or some

60
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:51,031
such, but just to

61
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,032
make the writing on the slide

62
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:55,000
simpler, I'm going to pretend we have 400 examples.

63
00:01:55,068 --> 00:01:57,045
So in that case, the

64
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,007
batch gradient descent learning rule

65
00:01:59,056 --> 00:02:00,093
has this 400 and the

66
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,093
sum from i equals 1 through

67
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:05,004
400 through my 400 examples

68
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,089
here, and if m

69
00:02:07,004 --> 00:02:09,078
is large, then this is a computationally expensive step.

70
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,083
So, what the MapReduce idea

71
00:02:13,025 --> 00:02:14,046
does is the following, and

72
00:02:14,088 --> 00:02:15,074
I should say the map

73
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:16,093
reduce idea is due to

74
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:20,018
two researchers, Jeff Dean

75
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:22,006
and Sanjay Gimawat.

76
00:02:22,063 --> 00:02:23,049
Jeff Dean, by the way, is

77
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,052
one of the most legendary engineers in

78
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:28,030
all of Silicon Valley and he

79
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,053
kind of built a large

80
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:31,066
fraction of the architectural

81
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:34,077
infrastructure that all of Google runs on today.

82
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,031
But here's the map reduce idea.

83
00:02:37,084 --> 00:02:38,056
So, let's say I have

84
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:39,084
some training set, if we

85
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,021
want to denote by this box here

86
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:42,075
of X Y pairs,

87
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:47,072
where it's X1, Y1, down

88
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,063
to my 400 examples,

89
00:02:50,052 --> 00:02:51,065
Xm, Ym.

90
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:53,078
So, that's my training set with 400 training examples.

91
00:02:55,006 --> 00:02:56,055
In the MapReduce idea, one way

92
00:02:56,068 --> 00:02:58,018
to do, is split this training

93
00:02:58,056 --> 00:03:00,050
set in to different subsets.

94
00:03:01,088 --> 00:03:02,059
I'm going to.

95
00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:04,015
assume for this example that

96
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:05,053
I have 4 computers,

97
00:03:06,015 --> 00:03:07,015
or 4 machines to run in

98
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,066
parallel on my training set,

99
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:10,056
which is why I'm splitting this into 4 machines.

100
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:12,028
If you have 10 machines or

101
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,081
100 machines, then you would

102
00:03:13,096 --> 00:03:15,088
split your training set into 10 pieces or 100 pieces or what have you.

103
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:19,071
And what the first of my

104
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:20,084
4 machines is to do,

105
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:23,016
say, is use just the

106
00:03:23,027 --> 00:03:25,016
first one quarter of my

107
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,068
training set--so use just the first 100 training examples.

108
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,043
And in particular, what it's

109
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:32,052
going to do is look at

110
00:03:32,062 --> 00:03:34,080
this summation, and compute

111
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,056
that summation for just the first 100 training examples.

112
00:03:40,003 --> 00:03:40,096
So let me write that up

113
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:42,053
I'm going to compute a variable

114
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,022
temp 1 to superscript 1

115
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:49,040
the first machine J equals

116
00:03:50,044 --> 00:03:52,015
sum from equals 1 through

117
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:53,015
100, and then I'm going to plug

118
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,061
in exactly that term there--so I have

119
00:03:57,025 --> 00:04:00,013
X-theta, Xi, minus Yi

120
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,022
times Xij, right?

121
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:05,068
So that's just that

122
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:07,046
gradient descent term up there.

123
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,078
And then similarly, I'm going

124
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,033
to take the second quarter

125
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:13,012
of my data and send it

126
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:14,052
to my second machine, and

127
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:15,068
my second machine will use

128
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,075
training examples 101 through 200

129
00:04:19,035 --> 00:04:21,017
and you will compute similar variables

130
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:22,087
of a temp to j which

131
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:24,044
is the same sum for index

132
00:04:24,088 --> 00:04:26,062
from examples 101 through 200.

133
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:29,068
And similarly machines 3

134
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:32,072
and 4 will use the

135
00:04:32,082 --> 00:04:34,011
third quarter and the fourth

136
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:36,055
quarter of my training set.

137
00:04:37,052 --> 00:04:38,094
So now each machine has

138
00:04:39,018 --> 00:04:40,057
to sum over 100 instead

139
00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:42,056
of over 400 examples and so

140
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:43,075
has to do only a quarter

141
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:45,022
of the work and thus presumably

142
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:48,000
it could do it about four times as fast.

143
00:04:49,037 --> 00:04:50,062
Finally, after all these machines

144
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:51,074
have done this work, I am

145
00:04:51,085 --> 00:04:53,056
going to take these temp variables

146
00:04:55,035 --> 00:04:56,048
and put them back together.

147
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,039
So I take these variables and

148
00:04:58,052 --> 00:04:59,094
send them all to a You

149
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,007
know centralized master server and

150
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,075
what the master will do

151
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,072
is combine these results together.

152
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:08,047
and in particular, it will

153
00:05:08,077 --> 00:05:10,077
update my parameters theta

154
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,016
j according to theta

155
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,072
j gets updated as theta j

156
00:05:15,073 --> 00:05:17,056
minus Of the

157
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:19,050
learning rate alpha times one

158
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:22,093
over 400 times temp,

159
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,041
1, J, plus temp

160
00:05:27,075 --> 00:05:30,029
2j plus temp 3j

161
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,047
plus temp 4j and

162
00:05:35,056 --> 00:05:37,088
of course we have to do this separately for J equals 0.

163
00:05:37,098 --> 00:05:39,056
You know, up to

164
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:41,022
and within this number of features.

165
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:45,042
So operating this equation into I hope it's clear.

166
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:47,087
So what this equation

167
00:05:50,093 --> 00:05:53,022
is doing is exactly the

168
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:54,056
same is that when you

169
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:56,013
have a centralized master server

170
00:05:56,068 --> 00:05:57,094
that takes the results, the ten

171
00:05:58,004 --> 00:05:58,077
one j the ten two j

172
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,085
ten three j and ten four

173
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:01,075
j and adds them up

174
00:06:02,002 --> 00:06:03,043
and so of course the sum

175
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:04,095
of these four things.

176
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:07,081
Right, that's just the sum of

177
00:06:08,006 --> 00:06:09,043
this, plus the sum

178
00:06:09,075 --> 00:06:11,049
of this, plus the sum

179
00:06:11,062 --> 00:06:13,000
of this, plus the sum

180
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:14,029
of that, and those four

181
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:15,082
things just add up to

182
00:06:15,092 --> 00:06:17,074
be equal to this sum that

183
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,057
we're originally computing a batch stream descent.

184
00:06:20,058 --> 00:06:21,055
And then we have the alpha times

185
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:22,091
1 of 400, alpha times 1

186
00:06:23,035 --> 00:06:24,068
of 100, and this is

187
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:27,001
exactly equivalent to the

188
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:29,038
batch gradient descent algorithm, only,

189
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:30,087
instead of needing to sum

190
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:32,054
over all four hundred training

191
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:33,089
examples on just one

192
00:06:34,004 --> 00:06:35,027
machine, we can instead

193
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:37,045
divide up the work load on four machines.

194
00:06:39,008 --> 00:06:40,018
So, here's what the general

195
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:43,041
picture of the MapReduce technique looks like.

196
00:06:45,006 --> 00:06:46,050
We have some training sets, and

197
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:48,019
if we want to paralyze across four

198
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:49,010
machines, we are going to

199
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:51,067
take the training set and split it, you know, equally.

200
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,063
Split it as evenly as we can into four subsets.

201
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:57,011
Then we are going to take the

202
00:06:57,018 --> 00:06:59,056
4 subsets of the training data and send them to 4 different computers.

203
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,066
And each of the 4 computers

204
00:07:02,012 --> 00:07:03,056
can compute a summation over

205
00:07:03,094 --> 00:07:04,085
just one quarter of the

206
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,023
training set, and then

207
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:07,072
finally take each of

208
00:07:07,077 --> 00:07:09,031
the computers takes the results, sends

209
00:07:09,057 --> 00:07:12,072
them to a centralized server, which then combines the results together.

210
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:14,089
So, on the previous line

211
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,054
in that example, the bulk

212
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,091
of the work in gradient descent,

213
00:07:18,032 --> 00:07:20,013
was computing the sum from

214
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:22,026
i equals 1 to 400 of something.

215
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,011
So more generally, sum from

216
00:07:24,037 --> 00:07:25,056
i equals 1 to m

217
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:28,018
of that formula for gradient descent.

218
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,043
And now, because each of

219
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:31,088
the four computers can do just

220
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,080
a quarter of the work, potentially

221
00:07:34,035 --> 00:07:35,093
you can get up to a 4x speed up.

222
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:39,098
In particular, if there were

223
00:07:40,018 --> 00:07:41,089
no network latencies and

224
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,097
no costs of the network

225
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,044
communications to send the

226
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,044
data back and forth, you can

227
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:47,081
potentially get up to a 4x speed up.

228
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:49,041
Of course, in practice,

229
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,007
because of network latencies,

230
00:07:52,081 --> 00:07:54,050
the overhead of combining the

231
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,087
results afterwards and other factors,

232
00:07:56,063 --> 00:07:59,014
in practice you get slightly less than a 4x speedup.

233
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,027
But, none the less, this sort

234
00:08:01,036 --> 00:08:02,070
of macro juice approach does offer

235
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:04,056
us a way to process much

236
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:05,093
larger data sets than is

237
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:07,055
possible using a single computer.

238
00:08:08,076 --> 00:08:10,006
If you are thinking of applying

239
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,019
Map Reduce to some learning

240
00:08:12,035 --> 00:08:14,025
algorithm, in order to speed this up.

241
00:08:14,075 --> 00:08:16,016
By paralleling the computation

242
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:18,048
over different computers, the key

243
00:08:18,073 --> 00:08:20,004
question to ask yourself is,

244
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:22,018
can your learning algorithm be expressed

245
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:25,014
as a summation over the training set?

246
00:08:25,043 --> 00:08:26,043
And it turns out that many

247
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:28,010
learning algorithms can actually be

248
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,087
expressed as computing sums of

249
00:08:30,017 --> 00:08:31,081
functions over the training set and

250
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:34,002
the computational expense of running

251
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:35,048
them on large data sets is

252
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,080
because they need to sum over a very large training set.

253
00:08:38,062 --> 00:08:39,087
So, whenever your learning algorithm

254
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,035
can be expressed as a

255
00:08:41,045 --> 00:08:42,040
sum of the training set

256
00:08:42,065 --> 00:08:43,075
and whenever the bulk of the

257
00:08:43,086 --> 00:08:44,080
work of the learning algorithm

258
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,016
can be expressed as the sum

259
00:08:46,032 --> 00:08:47,077
of the training set, then mac

260
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:49,002
reviews might a good candidate

261
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,083
for scaling your learning algorithms through very, very good data sets.

262
00:08:53,087 --> 00:08:54,090
Lets just look at one more example.

263
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:58,012
Let's say that we want to use one of the advanced optimization algorithm.

264
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,042
So, things like, you

265
00:08:59,054 --> 00:09:00,046
know, l, b, f, g, s constant

266
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:02,096
gradient and so on, and

267
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:05,019
let's say we want to train a logistic regression of the algorithm.

268
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:08,067
For that, we need to compute two main quantities.

269
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:10,046
One is for the advanced

270
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:13,051
optimization algorithms like, you know, LPF and constant gradient.

271
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,026
We need to provide it a

272
00:09:15,052 --> 00:09:17,021
routine to compute the

273
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:18,075
cost function of the optimization objective.

274
00:09:20,022 --> 00:09:21,069
And so for logistic regression, you

275
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:22,087
remember that a cost function

276
00:09:23,065 --> 00:09:24,070
has this sort of sum over

277
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,034
the training set, and so

278
00:09:26,097 --> 00:09:28,098
if youre paralizing over

279
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:29,097
ten machines, you would split

280
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,063
up the training set onto ten

281
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,014
machines and have each

282
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:35,037
of the ten machines compute the sum

283
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:37,046
of this quantity over just

284
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:38,065
one tenth of the training

285
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:40,037
data.

286
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:41,054
Then, the other thing that the

287
00:09:42,011 --> 00:09:43,039
advanced optimization algorithms need,

288
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:44,078
is a routine to compute

289
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:47,015
these partial derivative terms.

290
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:48,098
Once again, these derivative terms, for

291
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,035
which it's a logistic regression, can

292
00:09:50,053 --> 00:09:51,084
be expressed as a sum over

293
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,012
the training set, and so once

294
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:54,060
again, similar to our earlier

295
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:56,005
example, you would have

296
00:09:56,051 --> 00:09:57,079
each machine compute that summation

297
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:01,016
over just some small fraction of your training data.

298
00:10:02,044 --> 00:10:04,059
And finally, having computed

299
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,025
all of these things, they could

300
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,051
then send their results to

301
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:09,039
a centralized server, which can

302
00:10:09,063 --> 00:10:12,075
then add up the partial sums.

303
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:14,040
This corresponds to adding up

304
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,000
those tenth i or

305
00:10:17,054 --> 00:10:21,087
tenth ij variables, which

306
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,061
were computed locally on machine

307
00:10:23,098 --> 00:10:25,038
number i, and so

308
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,079
the centralized server can sum

309
00:10:27,004 --> 00:10:28,022
these things up and get

310
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,023
the overall cost function

311
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,075
and get the overall partial derivative,

312
00:10:33,038 --> 00:10:35,071
which you can then pass through the advanced optimization algorithm.

313
00:10:36,088 --> 00:10:38,010
So, more broadly, by taking

314
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:40,078
other learning algorithms and

315
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:42,042
expressing them in sort of

316
00:10:42,072 --> 00:10:43,079
summation form or by expressing

317
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:45,065
them in terms of computing sums

318
00:10:45,099 --> 00:10:47,010
of functions over the training set,

319
00:10:47,074 --> 00:10:49,028
you can use the MapReduce technique to

320
00:10:49,044 --> 00:10:51,041
parallelize other learning algorithms as well,

321
00:10:51,071 --> 00:10:53,030
and scale them to very large training sets.

322
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:55,085
Finally, as one last comment,

323
00:10:56,038 --> 00:10:57,016
so far we have been

324
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,062
discussing MapReduce algorithms as

325
00:10:59,085 --> 00:11:01,039
allowing you to parallelize over

326
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:03,062
multiple computers, maybe multiple

327
00:11:03,094 --> 00:11:05,001
computers in a computer

328
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:08,005
cluster or over multiple computers in the data center.

329
00:11:09,014 --> 00:11:10,058
It turns out that sometimes even

330
00:11:10,076 --> 00:11:12,000
if you have just a single computer,

331
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:14,038
MapReduce can also be applicable.

332
00:11:15,052 --> 00:11:16,097
In particular, on many single

333
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:18,050
computers now, you can have

334
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,051
multiple processing cores.

335
00:11:21,016 --> 00:11:21,086
You can have multiple CPUs,

336
00:11:22,017 --> 00:11:23,012
and within each CPU you can

337
00:11:23,024 --> 00:11:26,016
have multiple proc cores.

338
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,016
If you have a large training

339
00:11:27,051 --> 00:11:28,046
set, what you can

340
00:11:28,057 --> 00:11:29,053
do if, say, you have

341
00:11:29,074 --> 00:11:31,051
a computer with 4

342
00:11:31,087 --> 00:11:33,039
computing cores, what you

343
00:11:33,046 --> 00:11:34,038
can do is, even on a

344
00:11:34,054 --> 00:11:35,058
single computer you can split the

345
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:37,067
training sets into pieces and

346
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,013
send the training set to different

347
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,096
cores within a single box,

348
00:11:41,022 --> 00:11:42,057
like within a single desktop computer

349
00:11:43,024 --> 00:11:45,007
or a single server and use

350
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,020
MapReduce this way to divvy up work load.

351
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Each of the cores can then

352
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,024
carry out the sum over,

353
00:11:50,095 --> 00:11:52,000
say, one quarter of your

354
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,044
training set, and then they

355
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,009
can take the partial sums and

356
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,088
combine them, in order

357
00:11:57,022 --> 00:11:59,036
to get the summation over the entire training set.

358
00:11:59,075 --> 00:12:01,027
The advantage of thinking

359
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,087
about MapReduce this way, as

360
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:04,075
paralyzing over cause within a

361
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:06,072
single machine, rather than parallelizing over

362
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:08,048
multiple machines is that,

363
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:09,097
this way you don't have to

364
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,074
worry about network latency, because

365
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:13,037
all the communication, all the

366
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:14,080
sending of the  [xx]

367
00:12:15,088 --> 00:12:18,001
back and forth, all that happens within a single machine.

368
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,016
And so network latency becomes

369
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:21,052
much less of an issue compared

370
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:23,004
to if you were using this

371
00:12:23,053 --> 00:12:26,008
to over different computers within the data sensor.

372
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:27,092
Finally, one last caveat on

373
00:12:27,099 --> 00:12:30,074
parallelizing within a multi-core machine.

374
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:32,060
Depending on the details

375
00:12:32,092 --> 00:12:34,028
of your implementation, if you have a

376
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:35,091
multi-core machine and if you

377
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:38,012
have certain numerical linear algebra libraries.

378
00:12:39,035 --> 00:12:40,049
It turns out that the sum numerical linear algebra libraries

379
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:43,094
that can automatically parallelize their

380
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:47,050
linear algebra operations across multiple cores within the machine.

381
00:12:48,076 --> 00:12:50,013
So if you're fortunate enough to

382
00:12:50,027 --> 00:12:51,029
be using one of those numerical linear algebra

383
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,098
libraries and certainly

384
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,012
this does not apply to every single library.

385
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,079
If you're using one of those libraries and.

386
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,067
If you have a very good vectorizing implementation of the learning algorithm.

387
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,071
Sometimes you can just implement

388
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,005
you standard learning algorithm in

389
00:13:05,014 --> 00:13:06,046
a vectorized fashion and not

390
00:13:06,071 --> 00:13:08,062
worry about parallelization and numerical linear algebra libararies

391
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:12,048
could take care of some of it for you.

392
00:13:12,062 --> 00:13:14,071
So you don't need to implement [xx] but.

393
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:16,057
for other any problems, taking advantage

394
00:13:17,017 --> 00:13:18,065
of this sort of map reducing commentation,

395
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:20,069
finding and using this

396
00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:22,007
MapReduce formulation and to

397
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:23,040
paralelize a cross coarse except

398
00:13:23,088 --> 00:13:24,097
yourself might be a

399
00:13:25,007 --> 00:13:27,030
good idea as well and could let you speed up your learning algorithm.

400
00:13:29,086 --> 00:13:31,038
In this video, we talked about

401
00:13:31,073 --> 00:13:33,064
the MapReduce approach to parallelizing

402
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,085
machine learning by taking a

403
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:37,045
data and spreading them across

404
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,065
many computers in the data center.

405
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:41,092
Although these ideas are

406
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:43,097
critical to paralysing across multiple

407
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:45,039
cores within a single computer

408
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:47,014
as well.

409
00:13:47,064 --> 00:13:48,060
Today there are some good

410
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:51,008
open source implementations of MapReduce,

411
00:13:51,044 --> 00:13:52,021
so there are many users

412
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:54,048
in open source system called

413
00:13:54,088 --> 00:13:55,082
Hadoop and using either your

414
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,058
own implementation or using someone

415
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:59,076
else's open source implementation, you

416
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:01,009
can use these ideas to

417
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,073
parallelize learning algorithms and

418
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:04,058
get them to run on much

419
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:05,098
larger data sets than is

420
00:14:06,032 --> 00:14:07,076
possible using just a single machine.
