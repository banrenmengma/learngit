1
00:00:00,054 --> 00:00:01,082
In the previous videos, we put

2
00:00:01,095 --> 00:00:03,022
together almost all

3
00:00:03,027 --> 00:00:04,062
the pieces you need in order

4
00:00:04,082 --> 00:00:07,016
to implement and train in your network.

5
00:00:07,094 --> 00:00:09,006
There's just one last idea I

6
00:00:09,011 --> 00:00:09,098
need to share with you, which

7
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,057
is the idea of random initialization.

8
00:00:13,022 --> 00:00:14,035
When you're running an algorithm like

9
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,099
gradient descent or also the

10
00:00:16,028 --> 00:00:17,080
advanced optimization algorithms, we

11
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:20,076
need to pick some initial value for the parameters theta.

12
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,098
So for the advanced optimization algorithm, you know,

13
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:24,062
it assumes that you will

14
00:00:24,078 --> 00:00:26,008
pass it some initial value

15
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:27,064
for the parameters theta.

16
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:30,067
Now let's consider gradient descent.

17
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:34,009
For that, you know, we also need to initialize theta to something.

18
00:00:34,057 --> 00:00:36,003
And then we can slowly take steps

19
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:38,082
go downhill, using graded descent,

20
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,092
to go downhill to minimize the function J of theta.

21
00:00:41,099 --> 00:00:43,096
So what do we set the initial value of theta to?

22
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:47,000
Is it possible to set

23
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:48,092
the initial value of theta

24
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:50,045
to the vector of all zeroes.

25
00:00:51,086 --> 00:00:54,079
Whereas this worked okay when we were using logistic regression.

26
00:00:55,063 --> 00:00:56,068
Initializing all of your

27
00:00:56,075 --> 00:00:57,096
parameters to zero actually

28
00:00:58,031 --> 00:01:00,028
does not work when you're trading a neural network.

29
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,014
Consider training the following neural network.

30
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:06,043
And let's say we initialized all of the parameters in the network to zero.

31
00:01:07,096 --> 00:01:09,020
And if you do that then

32
00:01:09,078 --> 00:01:10,092
what that means is that

33
00:01:11,015 --> 00:01:13,087
at the initialization this blue weight, that I'm covering blue

34
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,054
is going to equal to that weight.

35
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:17,051
So, they're both zero.

36
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:19,087
And this weight that I'm covering

37
00:01:20,032 --> 00:01:21,093
in in red, is equal to that weight.

38
00:01:22,054 --> 00:01:23,004
Which I'm covering it in red.

39
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:25,028
And also this weight, well

40
00:01:25,062 --> 00:01:26,050
which I'm covering it in green

41
00:01:26,068 --> 00:01:28,093
is going to be equal to the value of that weight.

42
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:32,081
And what that means is that both of your hidden units: a1 and a2

43
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:35,093
are going to be computing the same function

44
00:01:36,065 --> 00:01:36,081
of your inputs.

45
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:38,090
And thus, you end up with

46
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,087
for everyone of your training your examples.

47
00:01:41,043 --> 00:01:43,064
You end up with a(2)1 equals a(2)2.

48
00:01:46,095 --> 00:01:48,070
and moreover because, I'm not

49
00:01:48,095 --> 00:01:50,004
going to show this too much

50
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:51,042
detail, but because these out

51
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:52,098
going weights are the same you

52
00:01:53,007 --> 00:01:54,062
can also show that the

53
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,056
delta values are also going to be the same.

54
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,079
So concretely, you end up

55
00:01:57,096 --> 00:02:00,006
with delta 1 1,

56
00:02:00,076 --> 00:02:02,090
delta 2 1, equals delta 2 2.

57
00:02:06,012 --> 00:02:07,015
And if you work through the

58
00:02:07,023 --> 00:02:08,047
map further, what you can

59
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:09,099
show is that the partial derivatives

60
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:14,008
with respect to your parameters will satisfy the following.

61
00:02:15,012 --> 00:02:16,071
That the partial derivative

62
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:19,025
of the cost

63
00:02:19,058 --> 00:02:21,002
function with respect to

64
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,068
writing out the derivatives respect to

65
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,031
these two blue weights neural network.

66
00:02:26,018 --> 00:02:27,028
You'll find that these two partial

67
00:02:27,068 --> 00:02:30,034
derivatives are going to be equal to each other.

68
00:02:31,096 --> 00:02:33,018
And so, what this means, is

69
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:35,081
that even after say, one gradient descent update.

70
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:38,019
You're going to update, say this

71
00:02:38,046 --> 00:02:40,080
first blue weight with, you know, learning rate times this.

72
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:42,050
And you're going to update the second

73
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:44,062
blue weight to a sum learning rate times this.

74
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,087
But what this means is

75
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:47,009
that even after one gradient

76
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,033
descent update, those two

77
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,071
blue weights, those two blue

78
00:02:51,043 --> 00:02:53,005
color parameters will end

79
00:02:53,024 --> 00:02:54,096
up the same as each other.

80
00:02:55,018 --> 00:02:56,021
So they'll be some non-zero

81
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,071
value now, but this value

82
00:02:58,055 --> 00:02:59,052
will be equal to that value.

83
00:03:00,036 --> 00:03:02,078
And similarly, even after one gradient descent update.

84
00:03:03,068 --> 00:03:05,074
This value will equal to that value.

85
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:07,019
There will be some non-zero values.

86
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:09,044
Just that the two red values will be equal to each other.

87
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:11,075
And similarly the two green

88
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:13,071
weights, they'll both change values

89
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:16,034
but they'll both end up the same value as each other.

90
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:19,002
So after each update, the parameters corresponding

91
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,088
to the inputs going to each

92
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:22,087
of the two hidden units identical.

93
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,049
That's just saying that the two

94
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,059
green weights must be sustained,

95
00:03:25,063 --> 00:03:26,031
the two red weights must be

96
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:27,075
sustained, the two blue weights

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
are still the same and what

98
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:31,059
that means is that even after

99
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:33,006
one iteration of say, gradient

100
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,086
descent, you find that

101
00:03:35,059 --> 00:03:37,025
your two hidden units are still

102
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,037
computing exactly the same function that the input.

103
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:43,003
So you still have this a(1)2 equals a(2)2.

104
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,019
And so you're back to this case.

105
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:47,037
And as keep running gradient descent.

106
00:03:48,038 --> 00:03:50,093
The blue weights, the two blue weights will stay the same as each other.

107
00:03:51,018 --> 00:03:52,091
The two red weights will stay the same as each other.

108
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:54,099
The two green weights will stay the same as each other.

109
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:56,086
And what this means

110
00:03:57,012 --> 00:03:58,025
is that your neural network really

111
00:03:58,046 --> 00:03:59,097
can't compute very interesting functions.

112
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:01,090
Imagine that you had

113
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:03,066
not only two hidden

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,046
units but imagine

115
00:04:05,063 --> 00:04:07,009
that you had many many hidden units.

116
00:04:08,008 --> 00:04:09,015
Then what this is saying is that

117
00:04:09,043 --> 00:04:10,068
all of your hidden units are

118
00:04:10,074 --> 00:04:12,031
computing the exact same

119
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:16,030
feature, all of your hidden units are computing all of the exact same function of the input.

120
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:18,098
And this is a highly redundant representation.

121
00:04:20,013 --> 00:04:21,000
Because that means that your

122
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:24,016
final logistic regression unit, you know, really only gets to see one feature.

123
00:04:24,073 --> 00:04:25,045
Because all of these are the same

124
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,068
and this prevents your neural network from learning something interesting.

125
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,082
In order to get around this

126
00:04:32,095 --> 00:04:34,005
problem, the way we initialize

127
00:04:34,058 --> 00:04:35,068
the parameters of a neural network

128
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:37,066
therefore, is with random initialization.

129
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:43,012
Concretely, the problem we

130
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:44,047
saw on the previous slide

131
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,024
is sometimes called the problem

132
00:04:46,063 --> 00:04:49,004
of symmetric weights, that is if the weights all being the same.

133
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,047
And so this random initialization

134
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,024
is how we perform symmetry breaking.

135
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:56,048
So what we do is we

136
00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:58,019
initialize each value of

137
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,045
theta to a random

138
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:01,030
number between minus epsilon and epsilon.

139
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:03,019
So this is a notation to

140
00:05:03,031 --> 00:05:05,035
mean numbers between minus epsilon and plus epsilon.

141
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:07,043
So my weights on my

142
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:08,066
parameters are all going

143
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,047
to be randomly initialized between minus epsilon and plus epsilon.

144
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,032
The way I write code to do

145
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:16,076
this in octave, this I've said you know theta 1 to be equal to this.

146
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:19,062
So this rand 10 by 11.

147
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:21,006
That's how you compute

148
00:05:21,063 --> 00:05:23,062
a random 10 by 11

149
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:26,063
dimensional matrix, and all

150
00:05:27,006 --> 00:05:30,037
of the values are between 0 and 1.

151
00:05:30,057 --> 00:05:31,035
So these are going to

152
00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:32,069
be real numbers that take on

153
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:34,086
any continuous values between 0 and 1.

154
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:36,029
And so, if you take a

155
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:37,043
number between 0 and

156
00:05:37,055 --> 00:05:38,031
1, multiply it by 2

157
00:05:38,058 --> 00:05:39,055
times an epsilon, and

158
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,005
minus an epsilon, then you

159
00:05:41,016 --> 00:05:42,026
end up with a number that's

160
00:05:42,068 --> 00:05:44,016
between minus epsilon and plus epsilon.

161
00:05:45,063 --> 00:05:46,097
And incidentally, this epsilon here

162
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:48,041
has nothing to do

163
00:05:48,073 --> 00:05:49,086
with the epsilon that we were

164
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:51,070
using when we were doing gradient checking.

165
00:05:52,058 --> 00:05:54,006
So when we were doing numerical gradient checking,

166
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:57,006
there we were adding some values of epsilon to theta.

167
00:05:57,043 --> 00:05:59,056
This is, you know, an unrelated value of epsilon.

168
00:05:59,077 --> 00:06:00,058
Which is why I am denoting

169
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:02,019
in it epsilon, just to distinguish

170
00:06:02,048 --> 00:06:04,097
it from the value of epsilon we were using in gradient checking.

171
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:07,058
Absolutely, if you want to

172
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:09,062
initialize theta 2

173
00:06:09,063 --> 00:06:10,081
to a random 1 by

174
00:06:10,092 --> 00:06:13,043
11 matrix, you can do so using this piece of code here.

175
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:17,045
So, to summarize, to

176
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:18,091
train a neural network, what you

177
00:06:19,006 --> 00:06:20,085
should do is randomly initialize the

178
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:21,081
weights to, you know, small

179
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:23,037
values close to 0, between

180
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:24,074
minus epsilon and plus epsilon,

181
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:27,014
say, and then implement

182
00:06:27,062 --> 00:06:29,032
back-propagation; do gradient checking;

183
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,030
and use either gradient

184
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:32,062
descent or one of the

185
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:34,086
advanced optimization algorithms to try

186
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,025
to minimize J of theta

187
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,086
as a function of the

188
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:39,061
parameters theta starting from just

189
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:41,089
randomly chosen initial value for the parameters.

190
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:45,043
And by doing symmetry breaking, which is this process.

191
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,011
Hopefully, gradient descent or the

192
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:48,081
advanced optimization algorithms will be

193
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:50,070
able to find a good value of theta.
