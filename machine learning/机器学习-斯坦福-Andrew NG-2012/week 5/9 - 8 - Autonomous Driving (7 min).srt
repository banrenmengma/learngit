1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:01,010
In this video, I'd like to

2
00:00:01,019 --> 00:00:02,083
show you a fun and historically

3
00:00:03,039 --> 00:00:05,082
important example of Neural Network Learning.

4
00:00:06,071 --> 00:00:09,030
Of using a Neural Network for autonomous driving

5
00:00:09,086 --> 00:00:12,042
that is getting a car to learn to drive itself.

6
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:14,098
The video that I

7
00:00:15,013 --> 00:00:16,044
showed a minute, was something

8
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:18,028
that I've gotten from Dean Pomilieu,

9
00:00:18,046 --> 00:00:20,000
who Colleague who works

10
00:00:20,026 --> 00:00:22,000
out in Carnegie Mellon University out

11
00:00:22,014 --> 00:00:23,044
on the east coast of the United States,

12
00:00:24,046 --> 00:00:25,030
and in part of the

13
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:27,098
video you see visualizations like

14
00:00:28,023 --> 00:00:29,092
this, and what I should tell you what the visualization

15
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:31,017
looks like before starting to

16
00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:32,082
video.
Down here

17
00:00:33,017 --> 00:00:34,085
on the lower left is the

18
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,014
view seen by the car

19
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:37,057
of what's in front of it

20
00:00:37,084 --> 00:00:38,097
and so here you know, you will kind

21
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:40,025
of see you know, a road that's

22
00:00:40,045 --> 00:00:41,039
maybe going a bit to

23
00:00:41,046 --> 00:00:42,010
the left and going a little bit to

24
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:45,006
the right, and up

25
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:47,022
here on top, this

26
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:49,082
first horizontal bar shows the

27
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:51,050
direction selected by the

28
00:00:51,075 --> 00:00:53,010
human driver and is the

29
00:00:53,057 --> 00:00:54,063
location of this bright

30
00:00:55,017 --> 00:00:56,082
white band that shows the

31
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,049
steering direction selected by the

32
00:00:58,068 --> 00:01:00,045
human driver, where, you

33
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:01,078
know, here, far to the left

34
00:01:02,014 --> 00:01:03,028
corresponds to steering hard left;

35
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,018
here corresponds to steering hard

36
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:06,082
to the right; and so

37
00:01:06,098 --> 00:01:08,028
this location, which is a

38
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,039
little bit to the left,

39
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:10,073
a little bit left of

40
00:01:10,089 --> 00:01:12,012
center, means that the human

41
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:13,034
driver, at this point, was

42
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:14,059
steering slightly to the left. 
A

43
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:17,034
nd this second part here

44
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:18,079
corresponds to the steering

45
00:01:19,014 --> 00:01:20,071
direction selected by the

46
00:01:20,087 --> 00:01:22,001
learning algorithm; and again, the

47
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,006
location of this sort

48
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:24,079
of white band, means the

49
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,056
neural network was here, selecting

50
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,029
a steering direction just slightly to

51
00:01:28,037 --> 00:01:29,043
the left and in fact,

52
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:30,098
before the neural network starts

53
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:33,001
learning initially, you

54
00:01:33,017 --> 00:01:34,098
see that the network outputs a

55
00:01:35,017 --> 00:01:36,040
grey band, like a

56
00:01:36,057 --> 00:01:38,050
grey uniform, grey band throughout

57
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:40,026
this region, so the uniform

58
00:01:40,073 --> 00:01:42,020
grey fuzz corresponds to the

59
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:43,087
neural network having been randomly

60
00:01:44,045 --> 00:01:46,018
initialized, and initially having

61
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:47,095
no idea how to

62
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:49,065
drive the car, or initially having

63
00:01:50,004 --> 00:01:52,050
no idea what direction to steer in.

64
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:53,064
And it's only after it's learned

65
00:01:53,085 --> 00:01:55,029
for a while that it will then start

66
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,051
to output like a solid white

67
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:58,064
band in just a small

68
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,026
part of the region corresponding

69
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,087
to choosing a particular steering direction.

70
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:04,070
And that corresponds to when a neural network.

71
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:06,089
Becomes more confident in selecting, you know,

72
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:09,025
a and in one

73
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:11,056
location rather than outputting

74
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:13,011
a sort of light gray

75
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,056
fuzz, but instead outputting

76
00:02:14,096 --> 00:02:17,000
a white band that's

77
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,021
more constantly selecting one steering direction.

78
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:21,087
Alban is a system

79
00:02:22,034 --> 00:02:24,084
of artificial neural networks, that learns to steer

80
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:26,040
by watching a person drive. Alban

81
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:29,055
is designed to control the

82
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,031
tube a modified army

83
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:32,084
Humvee who could put

84
00:02:33,002 --> 00:02:35,019
sensors, computers and actuators

85
00:02:36,015 --> 00:02:37,080
for autonomous navigation experiments.

86
00:02:41,018 --> 00:02:42,047
The initial spec in

87
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:44,072
configuring Alban is training in

88
00:02:46,077 --> 00:02:48,015
the training the person drives

89
00:02:48,058 --> 00:02:50,063
to be a car while Alban watches.

90
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:58,041
Once every two seconds, Alban

91
00:02:58,068 --> 00:02:59,080
digitizes a video image

92
00:03:00,031 --> 00:03:03,025
of the road ahead, and records the person's steering direction.

93
00:03:11,078 --> 00:03:13,013
This training image is reduced

94
00:03:13,056 --> 00:03:15,025
in resolution to 30 by

95
00:03:15,046 --> 00:03:16,097
32 pixels and provided

96
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:19,009
as input to Alban's three-layer

97
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:21,091
network.

98
00:03:22,046 --> 00:03:25,033
Using the back propagation learning algorithm; Alban

99
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:26,059
is training to output the same

100
00:03:26,093 --> 00:03:28,044
steering direction as the

101
00:03:28,053 --> 00:03:29,096
human driver for that image

102
00:03:33,044 --> 00:03:35,096
Initially, the network's steering response is random.

103
00:03:43,093 --> 00:03:45,000
After about two minutes of

104
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:46,075
training, the network learns

105
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:48,072
to accurately imitate the steering

106
00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:56,043
reactions of the

107
00:03:58,066 --> 00:04:03,043
human driver. This same

108
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:06,043
training procedure is repeated for other road types.

109
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:11,068
After the networks have been trained the

110
00:04:11,077 --> 00:04:12,090
operator pushes the run

111
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,065
switch and often begins

112
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:20,037
driving. 12 times

113
00:04:20,087 --> 00:04:23,000
per second, Alban digitizes an

114
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:25,012
image and feeds it to its neural networks.

115
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,098
Each network, running in parallel,

116
00:04:35,093 --> 00:04:38,013
produces a steering direction and a measure of it's

117
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:40,005
confidence in its response.

118
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:49,048
The steering direction

119
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:51,012
from the most confident network.

120
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:53,064
In this case, the network trained

121
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,063
for the one-lane road is used to control the vehicle.

122
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:07,083
Suddenly, an intersection appears ahead

123
00:05:08,031 --> 00:05:09,035
of the vehicle.

124
00:05:23,008 --> 00:05:24,044
As the vehicle approaches the intersection,

125
00:05:25,068 --> 00:05:27,074
the confidence of the one-lane network decreases.

126
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:40,002
As it crosses the intersection, and

127
00:05:40,012 --> 00:05:41,016
the two-lane road ahead comes

128
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:44,061
into view, the confidence of the two-lane network rises.

129
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:53,000
When it's confidence rises, the two-lane

130
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:54,062
network is selected to steer,

131
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:56,077
safely guiding the vehicle

132
00:05:57,037 --> 00:05:59,002
into it's lane, on the two-lane road.

133
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,067
So that was autonomous

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,079
driving using a neural network. Of course, there are more

135
00:06:10,014 --> 00:06:11,006
recently more modern attempts

136
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:14,000
to do autonomous driving in a few properties, in

137
00:06:14,018 --> 00:06:15,073
the U.S., in Europe, and so on.

138
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:18,004
They're giving more robust driving

139
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:19,075
controllers than this, but I

140
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:21,091
think it's still pretty remarkable and

141
00:06:22,004 --> 00:06:23,018
pretty amazing how a simple

142
00:06:23,068 --> 00:06:25,043
neural network trained with back-propagation

143
00:06:26,013 --> 00:06:28,099
can, you know, actually learn to drive a car somewhat well.
