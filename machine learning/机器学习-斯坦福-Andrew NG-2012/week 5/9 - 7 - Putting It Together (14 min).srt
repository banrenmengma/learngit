1
00:00:00,024 --> 00:00:01,056
So, it's taken us a

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,069
lot of videos to get through

3
00:00:03,012 --> 00:00:04,048
the neural network learning algorithm.

4
00:00:05,062 --> 00:00:06,063
In this video, what I'd like

5
00:00:06,079 --> 00:00:08,008
to do is try to

6
00:00:08,034 --> 00:00:10,003
put all the pieces together, to

7
00:00:10,036 --> 00:00:12,011
give a overall summary or

8
00:00:12,035 --> 00:00:13,041
a bigger picture view, of how

9
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:15,028
all the pieces fit together and

10
00:00:15,052 --> 00:00:16,098
of the overall process of how

11
00:00:17,026 --> 00:00:18,082
to implement a neural network learning algorithm.

12
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:23,021
When training a neural network, the

13
00:00:23,028 --> 00:00:24,028
first thing you need to do

14
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,092
is pick some network architecture

15
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,094
and by architecture I just

16
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,051
mean connectivity pattern between the neurons.

17
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:31,083
So, you know, we might choose

18
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,077
between say, a neural network

19
00:00:34,022 --> 00:00:35,043
with three input units

20
00:00:35,096 --> 00:00:37,039
and five hidden units and

21
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,056
four output units versus one

22
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,046
of 3, 5 hidden, 5

23
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,042
hidden, 4 output and

24
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:45,021
here are 3, 5,

25
00:00:45,054 --> 00:00:47,006
5, 5 units in each

26
00:00:47,032 --> 00:00:48,086
of three hidden layers and four

27
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:50,025
open units, and so these

28
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:52,000
choices of how many hidden

29
00:00:52,027 --> 00:00:53,040
units in each layer

30
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:55,056
and how many hidden layers, those

31
00:00:55,078 --> 00:00:57,057
are architecture choices.

32
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,067
So, how do you make these choices?

33
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:01,027
Well first, the number

34
00:01:01,053 --> 00:01:03,084
of input units well that's pretty well defined.

35
00:01:04,068 --> 00:01:05,095
And once you decides on the fix

36
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:07,087
set of features x the

37
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:09,042
number of input units will just be, you know, the

38
00:01:10,014 --> 00:01:12,018
dimension of your features x(i)

39
00:01:12,032 --> 00:01:14,046
would be determined by that.

40
00:01:14,076 --> 00:01:15,096
And if you are doing multiclass

41
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,037
classifications the number of

42
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:18,031
output of this will be

43
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:19,071
determined by the number

44
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:22,085
of classes in your classification problem.

45
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:24,089
And just a reminder if you have

46
00:01:25,015 --> 00:01:27,029
a multiclass classification where y

47
00:01:27,056 --> 00:01:28,096
takes on say values between

48
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:31,034
1 and 10, so that

49
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:33,056
you have ten possible classes.

50
00:01:34,068 --> 00:01:37,020
Then remember to right, your

51
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:39,034
output y as these were the vectors.

52
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:41,056
So instead of clause one, you

53
00:01:41,073 --> 00:01:42,084
recode it as a vector

54
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:44,059
like that, or for

55
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:47,028
the second class you recode it as a vector like that.

56
00:01:48,012 --> 00:01:49,007
So if one of these

57
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,000
apples takes on

58
00:01:51,014 --> 00:01:53,090
the fifth class, you know, y equals 5, then

59
00:01:54,012 --> 00:01:55,012
what you're showing to your neural

60
00:01:55,037 --> 00:01:56,084
network is not actually a value

61
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:59,051
of y equals 5, instead here

62
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:00,095
at the upper layer which would

63
00:02:01,028 --> 00:02:02,065
have ten output units, you

64
00:02:02,073 --> 00:02:03,092
will instead feed to the

65
00:02:04,006 --> 00:02:05,070
vector which you know

66
00:02:07,046 --> 00:02:08,043
with one in the fifth

67
00:02:08,077 --> 00:02:11,005
position and a bunch of zeros down here.

68
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,046
So the choice of number

69
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:14,033
of input units and number of output units

70
00:02:14,096 --> 00:02:16,059
is maybe somewhat reasonably straightforward.

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,094
And as for the number

72
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,003
of hidden units and the

73
00:02:21,013 --> 00:02:23,011
number of hidden layers, a

74
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:24,034
reasonable default is to

75
00:02:24,053 --> 00:02:26,000
use a single hidden layer

76
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:28,003
and so this type of

77
00:02:28,087 --> 00:02:30,040
neural network shown on the left with

78
00:02:30,058 --> 00:02:33,027
just one hidden layer is probably the most common.

79
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:35,087
Or if you use more

80
00:02:36,013 --> 00:02:38,040
than one hidden layer, again the

81
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:39,059
reasonable default will be to

82
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,094
have the same number of

83
00:02:41,012 --> 00:02:42,056
hidden units in every single layer.

84
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:44,059
So here we have two

85
00:02:45,002 --> 00:02:46,037
hidden layers and each

86
00:02:46,061 --> 00:02:47,065
of these hidden layers have the

87
00:02:47,086 --> 00:02:49,050
same number five of hidden

88
00:02:49,078 --> 00:02:50,074
units and here we have, you know,

89
00:02:51,059 --> 00:02:53,002
three hidden layers and

90
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:54,078
each of them has the same

91
00:02:54,097 --> 00:02:56,040
number, that is five hidden units.

92
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,043
Rather than doing this sort

93
00:02:59,074 --> 00:03:02,084
of network architecture on the left would be a perfect ably reasonable default.

94
00:03:04,002 --> 00:03:04,078
And as for the number

95
00:03:05,012 --> 00:03:07,003
of hidden units - usually, the

96
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:08,009
more hidden units the better;

97
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:09,063
it's just that if you have

98
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,011
a lot of hidden units, it

99
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:13,015
can become more computationally expensive, but

100
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,084
very often, having more hidden units is a good thing.

101
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:18,056
And usually the number of hidden

102
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:20,081
units in each layer will be maybe

103
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:22,012
comparable to the dimension

104
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:23,066
of x, comparable to the

105
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:24,094
number of features, or it could

106
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:26,087
be any where from same number

107
00:03:27,018 --> 00:03:29,059
of hidden units of input features to

108
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:32,043
maybe so that three or four times of that.

109
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:34,077
So having the number of hidden units is comparable.

110
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:36,034
You know, several times, or

111
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,037
some what bigger than the number

112
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:38,075
of input features is often

113
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:41,031
a useful thing to do So,

114
00:03:42,015 --> 00:03:43,049
hopefully this gives you one

115
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:45,013
reasonable set of default choices

116
00:03:45,065 --> 00:03:47,077
for neural architecture and and

117
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,046
if you follow these guidelines, you

118
00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:50,058
will probably get something that works

119
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:52,018
well, but in a

120
00:03:52,036 --> 00:03:53,077
later set of videos where

121
00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:55,027
I will talk specifically about

122
00:03:55,058 --> 00:03:56,090
advice for how to apply

123
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,077
algorithms, I will actually

124
00:03:58,084 --> 00:04:01,087
say a lot more about how to choose a neural network architecture.

125
00:04:02,053 --> 00:04:03,091
Or actually have quite

126
00:04:03,096 --> 00:04:04,096
a lot I want to

127
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:06,018
say later to make good choices

128
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:08,078
for the number of hidden units, the number of hidden layers, and so on.

129
00:04:10,062 --> 00:04:12,031
Next, here's what we

130
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,074
need to implement in order to

131
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,036
trade in neural network, there are

132
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,081
actually six steps that I

133
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,002
have; I have four on this

134
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:19,010
slide and two more steps

135
00:04:19,037 --> 00:04:21,048
on the next slide.

136
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:22,022
First step is to set up the neural

137
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:23,050
network and to randomly

138
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:25,056
initialize the values of the weights.

139
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:27,000
And we usually initialize the

140
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,070
weights to small values near zero.

141
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,012
Then we implement forward propagation

142
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,006
so that we can input

143
00:04:35,048 --> 00:04:37,014
any excellent neural network and

144
00:04:37,049 --> 00:04:38,086
compute h of x which is this

145
00:04:39,006 --> 00:04:40,081
output vector of the y values.

146
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:45,091
We then also implement code to

147
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,050
compute this cost function j of theta.

148
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:51,016
And next we implement

149
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:53,032
back-prop, or the back-propagation

150
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:55,068
algorithm, to compute these

151
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:58,000
partial derivatives terms, partial

152
00:04:58,043 --> 00:04:59,082
derivatives of j of theta

153
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:04,024
with respect to the parameters. Concretely, to implement back prop.

154
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,087
Usually we will do that

155
00:05:06,025 --> 00:05:08,045
with a fore loop over the training examples.

156
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:10,064
Some of you may have heard of

157
00:05:10,082 --> 00:05:12,063
advanced, and frankly very

158
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:14,050
advanced factorization methods where you

159
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:15,072
don't have a four-loop over

160
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:18,057
the m-training examples, that the

161
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:19,089
first time you're implementing back prop

162
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:21,042
there should almost certainly the four

163
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:22,098
loop in your code,

164
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,000
where you're iterating over the examples,

165
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:27,075
you know, x1, y1, then so

166
00:05:28,002 --> 00:05:29,050
you do forward prop and

167
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:30,039
back prop on the first

168
00:05:30,085 --> 00:05:32,050
example, and then in

169
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,073
the second iteration of the

170
00:05:33,077 --> 00:05:35,036
four-loop, you do forward propagation

171
00:05:35,098 --> 00:05:38,005
and back propagation on the second example, and so on.

172
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:40,089
Until you get through the final example.

173
00:05:41,068 --> 00:05:43,011
So there should be

174
00:05:43,023 --> 00:05:44,025
a four-loop in your implementation

175
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:47,018
of back prop, at least the first time implementing it.

176
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:49,016
And then there are frankly

177
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:50,051
somewhat complicated ways to do

178
00:05:50,088 --> 00:05:52,066
this without a four-loop, but

179
00:05:52,081 --> 00:05:53,094
I definitely do not recommend

180
00:05:54,036 --> 00:05:55,033
trying to do that much more

181
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:58,042
complicated version the first time you try to implement back prop.

182
00:05:59,085 --> 00:06:00,092
So concretely, we have a

183
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,019
four-loop over my m-training examples

184
00:06:03,024 --> 00:06:04,062
and inside the four-loop we're

185
00:06:04,076 --> 00:06:06,030
going to perform fore prop

186
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:08,008
and back prop using just this one example.

187
00:06:09,031 --> 00:06:10,031
And what that means is that

188
00:06:10,056 --> 00:06:12,047
we're going to take x(i), and

189
00:06:12,068 --> 00:06:14,000
feed that to my input layer,

190
00:06:14,076 --> 00:06:16,037
perform forward-prop, perform back-prop

191
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:18,036
and that will if all of

192
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:19,083
these activations and all of

193
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:22,008
these delta terms for all

194
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,043
of the layers of all my

195
00:06:23,076 --> 00:06:24,072
units in the neural

196
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:27,017
network then still

197
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:28,075
inside this four-loop, let

198
00:06:29,018 --> 00:06:30,044
me draw some curly braces

199
00:06:30,093 --> 00:06:31,094
just to show the scope with

200
00:06:32,002 --> 00:06:32,093
the four-loop, this is in

201
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:35,048
octave code of course, but it's more a sequence Java

202
00:06:36,018 --> 00:06:38,035
code, and a four-loop encompasses all this.

203
00:06:39,006 --> 00:06:40,006
We're going to compute those delta

204
00:06:40,048 --> 00:06:43,068
terms, which are is the formula that we gave earlier.

205
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:47,037
Plus, you know, delta l plus one times

206
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:51,014
a, l transpose of the code.

207
00:06:51,049 --> 00:06:53,054
And then finally, outside the

208
00:06:54,018 --> 00:06:55,062
having computed these delta

209
00:06:55,097 --> 00:06:57,055
terms, these accumulation terms, we

210
00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:59,005
would then have some other

211
00:06:59,017 --> 00:07:00,043
code and then that will

212
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:03,024
allow us to compute these partial derivative terms.

213
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:05,044
Right and these partial derivative

214
00:07:05,097 --> 00:07:07,001
terms have to take

215
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,026
into account the regularization term lambda as well.

216
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:13,024
And so, those formulas were given in the earlier video.

217
00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:15,072
So, how do you done that

218
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,007
you now hopefully have code to

219
00:07:18,018 --> 00:07:20,005
compute these partial derivative terms.

220
00:07:21,018 --> 00:07:23,002
Next is step five, what I

221
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:24,042
do is then use gradient

222
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:26,069
checking to compare these partial

223
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:28,052
derivative terms that were computed. So, I've

224
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:30,098
compared the versions computed using

225
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:33,099
back propagation versus the

226
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:36,047
partial derivatives computed using the numerical

227
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,085
estimates as using numerical estimates of the derivatives.

228
00:07:40,035 --> 00:07:41,081
So, I do gradient checking to make

229
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:44,033
sure that both of these give you very similar values.

230
00:07:45,082 --> 00:07:47,041
Having done gradient checking just now reassures

231
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,027
us that our implementation of back

232
00:07:49,058 --> 00:07:51,047
propagation is correct, and is

233
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:52,085
then very important that we disable

234
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:54,070
gradient checking, because the gradient

235
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:57,014
checking code is computationally very slow.

236
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:00,087
And finally, we then

237
00:08:01,012 --> 00:08:03,027
use an optimization algorithm such

238
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,093
as gradient descent, or one of

239
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,051
the advanced optimization methods such

240
00:08:07,074 --> 00:08:10,001
as LB of GS, contract gradient has

241
00:08:10,025 --> 00:08:13,012
embodied into fminunc or other  optimization methods.

242
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,050
We use these together with

243
00:08:15,073 --> 00:08:17,037
back propagation, so back

244
00:08:17,062 --> 00:08:18,067
propagation is the thing

245
00:08:18,076 --> 00:08:20,063
that computes these partial derivatives for us.

246
00:08:21,073 --> 00:08:22,068
And so, we know how to

247
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:24,001
compute the cost function, we know

248
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,055
how to compute the partial derivatives using

249
00:08:25,082 --> 00:08:27,041
back propagation, so we

250
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,082
can use one of these optimization methods

251
00:08:29,057 --> 00:08:30,085
to try to minimize j of

252
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:33,050
theta as a function of the parameters theta.

253
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:35,040
And by the way, for

254
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:37,033
neural networks, this cost function

255
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:39,062
j of theta is non-convex,

256
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,049
or is not convex and so

257
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:45,060
it can theoretically be susceptible

258
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,048
to local minima, and in

259
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:49,058
fact algorithms like gradient descent and

260
00:08:49,084 --> 00:08:51,095
the advance optimization methods can,

261
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,065
in theory, get stuck in local

262
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,029
optima, but it turns out

263
00:08:56,048 --> 00:08:57,067
that in practice this is

264
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,023
not usually a huge problem

265
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:00,079
and even though we can't guarantee

266
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:02,032
that these algorithms will find a

267
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,025
global optimum, usually algorithms like

268
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:05,087
gradient descent will do a

269
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:07,070
very good job minimizing this

270
00:09:07,085 --> 00:09:09,023
cost function j of

271
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:10,035
theta and get a

272
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,082
very good local minimum, even

273
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:13,069
if it doesn't get to the global optimum.

274
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,095
Finally, gradient descents for

275
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,050
a neural network might still seem a little bit magical.

276
00:09:20,016 --> 00:09:21,067
So, let me just show one

277
00:09:21,088 --> 00:09:22,099
more figure to try to get

278
00:09:23,016 --> 00:09:25,065
that intuition about what gradient descent for a neural network is doing.

279
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,046
This was actually similar to the

280
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:31,019
figure that I was using earlier to explain gradient descent.

281
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:32,075
So, we have some cost

282
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:34,048
function, and we have

283
00:09:34,071 --> 00:09:36,059
a number of parameters in our neural network. Right

284
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,019
here I've just written down two of the parameter values.

285
00:09:40,008 --> 00:09:41,025
In reality, of course, in

286
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:43,057
the neural network, we can have lots of parameters with these.

287
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:46,098
Theta one, theta two--all of these are matrices, right?

288
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:48,012
So we can have very high dimensional

289
00:09:48,058 --> 00:09:49,087
parameters but because of

290
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:51,062
the limitations the source of

291
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:52,097
parts we can draw. I'm pretending

292
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,084
that we have only two parameters in this neural network.

293
00:09:56,026 --> 00:09:56,088
Although obviously we have a lot more in practice.

294
00:09:59,027 --> 00:10:00,070
Now, this cost function j of

295
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:02,047
theta measures how well

296
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:04,073
the neural network fits the training data.

297
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,091
So, if you take a point

298
00:10:07,012 --> 00:10:08,059
like this one, down here,

299
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,017
that's a point where j

300
00:10:11,046 --> 00:10:12,058
of theta is pretty low,

301
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:16,016
and so this corresponds to a setting of the parameters.

302
00:10:17,001 --> 00:10:17,084
There's a setting of the parameters

303
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,091
theta, where, you know, for most

304
00:10:20,013 --> 00:10:22,045
of the training examples, the output

305
00:10:24,012 --> 00:10:26,026
of my hypothesis, that may

306
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,041
be pretty close to y(i)

307
00:10:27,064 --> 00:10:28,072
and if this is

308
00:10:28,084 --> 00:10:31,055
true than that's what causes my cost function to be pretty low.

309
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:33,076
Whereas in contrast, if you were

310
00:10:33,082 --> 00:10:35,013
to take a value like that, a

311
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,025
point like that corresponds to,

312
00:10:38,008 --> 00:10:39,025
where for many training examples,

313
00:10:39,088 --> 00:10:40,077
the output of my neural

314
00:10:41,003 --> 00:10:42,086
network is far from

315
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:44,034
the actual value y(i)

316
00:10:44,053 --> 00:10:45,085
that was observed in the training set.

317
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:47,048
So points like this on the

318
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:50,010
line correspond to where the

319
00:10:50,045 --> 00:10:51,045
hypothesis, where the neural

320
00:10:51,074 --> 00:10:53,033
network is outputting values

321
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:54,080
on the training set that are

322
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:56,025
far from y(i). So, it's not

323
00:10:56,047 --> 00:10:57,097
fitting the training set well, whereas

324
00:10:58,016 --> 00:10:59,063
points like this with low

325
00:10:59,097 --> 00:11:01,029
values of the cost function corresponds

326
00:11:02,012 --> 00:11:03,037
to where j of theta

327
00:11:04,012 --> 00:11:05,026
is low, and therefore corresponds

328
00:11:05,095 --> 00:11:07,059
to where the neural network happens

329
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:09,028
to be fitting my training set

330
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,034
well, because I mean this is what's

331
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:14,007
needed to be true in order for j of theta to be small.

332
00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:16,080
So what gradient descent does is

333
00:11:16,087 --> 00:11:18,033
we'll start from some random

334
00:11:18,073 --> 00:11:20,029
initial point like that

335
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:22,099
one over there, and it will repeatedly go downhill.

336
00:11:24,003 --> 00:11:25,039
And so what back propagation is

337
00:11:25,057 --> 00:11:27,022
doing is computing the direction

338
00:11:27,094 --> 00:11:29,037
of the gradient, and what

339
00:11:29,051 --> 00:11:30,074
gradient descent is doing is

340
00:11:31,003 --> 00:11:32,005
it's taking little steps downhill

341
00:11:32,087 --> 00:11:34,022
until hopefully it gets to,

342
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:36,040
in this case, a pretty good local optimum.

343
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,025
So, when you implement back

344
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,084
propagation and use gradient

345
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,041
descent or one of the

346
00:11:42,084 --> 00:11:44,075
advanced optimization methods, this picture

347
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:47,028
sort of explains what the algorithm is doing.

348
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:48,082
It's trying to find a value

349
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:50,091
of the parameters where the

350
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:52,017
output values in the neural

351
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,029
network closely matches the

352
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,051
values of the y(i)'s

353
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:58,079
observed in your training set.

354
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,025
So, hopefully this gives you

355
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,061
a better sense of how

356
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:03,092
the many different pieces of

357
00:12:04,012 --> 00:12:05,075
neural network learning fit together.

358
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:09,000
In case even after this video, in

359
00:12:09,012 --> 00:12:10,012
case you still feel like there

360
00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:11,041
are, like, a lot of different pieces

361
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:13,045
and it's not entirely clear what

362
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:14,066
some of them do or how all

363
00:12:14,086 --> 00:12:17,075
of these pieces come together, that's actually okay.

364
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:21,077
Neural network learning and back propagation is a complicated algorithm.

365
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,096
And even though I've seen

366
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:25,034
the math behind back propagation

367
00:12:25,086 --> 00:12:26,071
for many years and I've used

368
00:12:27,002 --> 00:12:28,047
back propagation, I think very

369
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:30,021
successfully, for many years, even

370
00:12:30,037 --> 00:12:31,050
today I still feel like I

371
00:12:31,057 --> 00:12:32,066
don't always have a great

372
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,061
grasp of exactly what back propagation is doing sometimes.

373
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,085
And what the optimization process

374
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:41,048
looks like of minimizing j if theta.

375
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:42,083
Much this is a much harder algorithm

376
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:44,067
to feel like I have a

377
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,059
much less good handle on

378
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:47,069
exactly what this is doing

379
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:49,036
compared to say, linear regression or logistic regression.

380
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:53,017
Which were mathematically and conceptually

381
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,009
much simpler and much cleaner algorithms.

382
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,002
But so in case if you feel the

383
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:58,055
same way, you know, that's actually perfectly

384
00:12:58,097 --> 00:13:01,000
okay, but if you

385
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:02,078
do implement back propagation, hopefully

386
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,025
what you find is that this

387
00:13:04,046 --> 00:13:05,040
is one of the most powerful

388
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:08,002
learning algorithms and if you

389
00:13:08,012 --> 00:13:09,050
implement this algorithm, implement back propagation,

390
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:11,023
implement one of these optimization

391
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:13,025
methods, you find that

392
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:14,094
back propagation will be able

393
00:13:15,038 --> 00:13:17,033
to fit very complex, powerful, non-linear

394
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,037
functions to your data,

395
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,005
and this is one of the

396
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:22,078
most effective learning algorithms we have today.
