1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:01,054
In this video, I'd like you

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,068
to work in through our example

3
00:00:03,039 --> 00:00:04,048
to show how a neural

4
00:00:04,073 --> 00:00:07,013
network can compute complex nonlinear hypotheses.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,024
In the last video, we saw

6
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:12,078
how a neural network can

7
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:13,090
be used to compute the functions

8
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,012
x1 and x2 and the

9
00:00:16,023 --> 00:00:18,041
function x1 or x2 when

10
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:20,025
x1 and x2 are binary.

11
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:23,007
That is, when they take on values of 0, 1.

12
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,057
We can also have a

13
00:00:24,062 --> 00:00:27,012
network to compute negation, that

14
00:00:27,032 --> 00:00:30,003
is to compute the function  "not x1".

15
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:31,067
Let me just write

16
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:33,067
down the ways associated with this network.

17
00:00:33,096 --> 00:00:35,035
We have only one input feature, x1

18
00:00:35,045 --> 00:00:36,054
in this case and the

19
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:38,021
bias unit plus 1 and

20
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:40,013
if I associate this with

21
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:42,060
the weights +10 and

22
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:45,070
-20 then my hypotheses is computing this.

23
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:47,074
H of x equals sigmoid of

24
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,060
10 minus 20 times x1

25
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,071
so when x1 is

26
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:52,088
equal to 0, my

27
00:00:52,096 --> 00:00:54,006
hypothesis will be computing

28
00:00:55,015 --> 00:00:57,034
g of 10 minus

29
00:00:57,096 --> 00:00:59,090
20 times 0 which is just 10.

30
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:01,060
And so that's approximately

31
00:01:02,043 --> 00:01:03,039
1, and when is x is

32
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,029
equal to 1 this will

33
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:05,073
be g of  -10, which

34
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,037
is therefore approximately equal to 0.

35
00:01:09,054 --> 00:01:10,031
And if you look at what

36
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:11,071
these values are, that's essentially

37
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:13,046
the "not x1" function.

38
00:01:14,056 --> 00:01:16,040
So to include negations, the

39
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,064
general idea is to put

40
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:20,045
a large negative weight in front

41
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:22,087
of the variable you want to negate.

42
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,070
So if it's -20, multiplied by

43
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:26,078
x1 and, you know, that's the general

44
00:01:27,023 --> 00:01:28,010
idea of how you end

45
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:30,050
up negating x1.

46
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,020
And so, in an example that

47
00:01:32,057 --> 00:01:33,040
I hope you will figure out

48
00:01:33,048 --> 00:01:35,009
yourself, if you want

49
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,040
to compute a function like this:

50
00:01:36,057 --> 00:01:38,087
"not x1 and not x2"

51
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:40,009
you know, while part of that would

52
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,085
probably be putting large negative

53
00:01:42,029 --> 00:01:44,015
weights in front of x1

54
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,032
and x2, but it should

55
00:01:45,057 --> 00:01:47,031
be feasible to get a

56
00:01:47,048 --> 00:01:49,090
neural network with just

57
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:52,081
one output unit to compute this as well.

58
00:01:52,098 --> 00:01:53,045
All right?

59
00:01:53,068 --> 00:01:55,012
So, this large fill

60
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:56,029
function "not x1 and not

61
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:57,098
x2" is going to

62
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,045
be equal to 1

63
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:06,095
if, and only if, x1

64
00:02:07,034 --> 00:02:09,086
equals x2 equals zero, right?

65
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,047
So this is a logical function, this

66
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:14,028
is not x1, that means x1 must be zero and not x2.

67
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:17,012
That means x2 must be equal to zero as well.

68
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,021
So this logical function is

69
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:20,021
equal to 1 if, and only

70
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:22,090
if, both x1 and x2 are equal to zero.

71
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,059
And hopefully, you should be

72
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:26,062
able to figure out how to make a

73
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:28,024
small neural network to compute

74
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:29,083
this logical function as well.

75
00:02:33,043 --> 00:02:34,034
Now, taking the three pieces

76
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:36,071
that we have put together, the

77
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,071
network for computing x1 and

78
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,062
x2 and the network for

79
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:42,006
computing not x1 and

80
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:44,016
not x2 and one last

81
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:45,090
network for computing x1 or

82
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:47,069
x2, we should be

83
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:49,041
able to put these three pieces together

84
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:51,027
to compute this x1, XNOR

85
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,081
x2 function.

86
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:54,093
And just to remind you, if

87
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,012
this was x1, x2, this

88
00:02:58,008 --> 00:02:58,083
function that we want to

89
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:00,090
compute would have negative examples

90
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:02,068
here and here and we'd

91
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,037
have positive examples there and there.

92
00:03:04,072 --> 00:03:06,027
And so clearly this, you know, we'll

93
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:08,040
need a nonlinear decision boundary

94
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:10,053
in order to separate the positive and negative examples.

95
00:03:12,094 --> 00:03:13,046
Let's draw the network.

96
00:03:14,025 --> 00:03:15,081
I'm going to take my input

97
00:03:16,056 --> 00:03:18,061
plus 1, x1, x2, and create

98
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:20,038
my first hidden unit here.

99
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm going to call this a(2)1

100
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,006
because that's my first hidden unit.

101
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,065
And I'm going to copy

102
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:27,040
the weights over from the Red

103
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:30,002
Network, x1 and x2 networks.

104
00:03:30,081 --> 00:03:32,040
So now minus 30, 20, 20.

105
00:03:32,065 --> 00:03:36,006
Next, let me create

106
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,069
a second hidden unit, which

107
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:39,096
I'm going to call a(2)2 that

108
00:03:40,034 --> 00:03:42,061
is the second hidden unit of layer two.

109
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:44,059
And I'm going to copy over the

110
00:03:44,074 --> 00:03:45,093
Cyan Network in the

111
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:47,008
middle, so I'm going

112
00:03:47,012 --> 00:03:49,022
to have the weights 10, minus 20,

113
00:03:50,015 --> 00:03:51,006
minus 20.

114
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:55,056
And so, let's pull some of the truth table values.

115
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:57,034
For the Red Network, we know

116
00:03:57,059 --> 00:03:59,034
that was computing the x1 and x2.

117
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:00,093
And so this is

118
00:04:01,003 --> 00:04:02,046
going to be approximately 0, 0,

119
00:04:02,053 --> 00:04:05,003
0, 1, depending on the values of x1 and x2.

120
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:09,056
And for a (2)2, that's the Cyan Network.

121
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:11,075
Well that we know the function not x1

122
00:04:12,024 --> 00:04:13,063
and not x2 then outputs 1,

123
00:04:13,063 --> 00:04:15,061
0, 0, 0 for the

124
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:17,082
4 values of x1 and x2.

125
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:19,056
Finally, I'm going to

126
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:21,030
create my output note, my

127
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:23,094
output unit that is a(3)1.

128
00:04:24,086 --> 00:04:26,023
This is one more output h

129
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:28,026
of x and I'm

130
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:30,002
going to copy over the OR

131
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:32,047
Network for that and I'm going to

132
00:04:32,086 --> 00:04:34,032
need a plus one bias unit here.

133
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:36,000
So, draw that in and I'm

134
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:38,036
going to copy over the weights from the Green Networks.

135
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:39,075
So, it's minus 10, 20, 20

136
00:04:42,037 --> 00:04:44,045
and we know earlier that this computes the OR function.

137
00:04:46,066 --> 00:04:48,019
So, let's go on the truth table entries.

138
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,066
For the first entry is 0

139
00:04:51,072 --> 00:04:53,093
or 1, which is gonna be

140
00:04:54,013 --> 00:04:55,070
1 then next 0 or

141
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,027
0, which is 0,

142
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:58,092
0, or 0, which is 0,

143
00:04:58,095 --> 00:05:00,042
1 or 0 and that all

144
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,044
is to 1 and thus, h

145
00:05:02,063 --> 00:05:04,081
of x is equal to 1

146
00:05:04,098 --> 00:05:06,026
when either both x1 and

147
00:05:06,077 --> 00:05:08,036
x2 are 0 or when x1 and

148
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,016
x2 are both 1. And

149
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:12,017
concretely, h of x

150
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:15,033
outputs 1 exactly at these

151
00:05:15,056 --> 00:05:16,085
two locations and it outputs

152
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:19,026
0 otherwise and thus,

153
00:05:19,056 --> 00:05:20,097
with this neural network, which

154
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,002
has an input layer, one

155
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:24,056
hidden layer and one output

156
00:05:24,087 --> 00:05:25,092
layer, we end up

157
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,044
with a nonlinear decision boundary that

158
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:30,051
computes this XNOR function.

159
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:33,038
And the more general intuition is

160
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,087
that in the input

161
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:35,077
layer, we just had our raw

162
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:37,039
inputs then we had

163
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:39,050
a hidden layer, which computed some

164
00:05:39,068 --> 00:05:41,013
slightly more complex functions of

165
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:42,007
the inputs that is shown

166
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:43,041
here, these are slightly more

167
00:05:43,055 --> 00:05:44,095
complex functions, and then by

168
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:46,050
adding yet another layer, we end

169
00:05:46,063 --> 00:05:49,002
up with an even more complex nonlinear function.

170
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:51,033
And this is the sort of

171
00:05:51,044 --> 00:05:53,081
intuition about why Neural

172
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,026
Networks can compute pretty complicated

173
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,026
functions that when you

174
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:58,055
have multiple layers, you have, you know,

175
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,030
relatively simple function of

176
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:01,050
the inputs, and the second layer,

177
00:06:02,016 --> 00:06:03,011
but the third layer can build

178
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,058
on that to compute even more

179
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:06,032
complex functions and then

180
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,073
the layer after that can compute even more complex functions.

181
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:11,074
To wrap up this video, I

182
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,032
want to show you a fun example of

183
00:06:13,048 --> 00:06:14,064
an application of a neural

184
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:16,039
network that captures this intuition

185
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:19,043
of the deeper layers computing more complex features.

186
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:21,004
I want to show you

187
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:22,048
a video that I got from

188
00:06:22,093 --> 00:06:24,017
a good friend of mine, Yon Khun.

189
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:26,024
Yon is a professor at

190
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:27,068
New York University, at NYU,

191
00:06:28,023 --> 00:06:29,039
and he was one of

192
00:06:29,047 --> 00:06:30,091
the early pioneers of neural

193
00:06:31,012 --> 00:06:32,058
network research and sort

194
00:06:32,093 --> 00:06:34,061
of a legend in the field

195
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,051
now and his ideas are

196
00:06:36,056 --> 00:06:38,033
used in all sorts of products

197
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,049
and applications throughout the world now.

198
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:42,023
So, I want to show you

199
00:06:42,037 --> 00:06:43,041
a video from some of his

200
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:44,088
early work in which he

201
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:46,011
was using a neural network

202
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,030
to recognize handwriting - to do handwritten digit recognition.

203
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:52,050
You might remember early in this

204
00:06:52,072 --> 00:06:53,062
class, at the start of this

205
00:06:53,073 --> 00:06:55,018
class, I said that one of

206
00:06:55,045 --> 00:06:56,072
early successes of neural networks

207
00:06:57,013 --> 00:06:58,017
was trying to use it

208
00:06:58,031 --> 00:07:00,057
to read zip codes, to help

209
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:02,093
us, you know, send mail along. So, to read postal codes.

210
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:04,091
So, this is one of the attempts.

211
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,022
So, this is one of the

212
00:07:06,064 --> 00:07:08,037
algorithms used to try to address that problem.

213
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:10,042
In the video I'll show you

214
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:12,063
this area here is the

215
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:14,042
input area that shows a

216
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:16,045
handwritten character shown to the

217
00:07:16,056 --> 00:07:18,061
network. This column here

218
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:21,035
shows a visualization of

219
00:07:21,045 --> 00:07:23,055
the features computed by so that the

220
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:24,075
first hidden layer of the

221
00:07:24,082 --> 00:07:26,008
network and so the first

222
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,042
hidden layer, you know, this visualization shows

223
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:31,018
different features, different edges and lines and so on detected.

224
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:35,025
This is a visualization of the next hidden layer.

225
00:07:35,052 --> 00:07:36,038
It's kind of harder to see

226
00:07:36,076 --> 00:07:38,017
how to understand deeper hidden

227
00:07:38,073 --> 00:07:39,068
layers and that's the visualization

228
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:41,082
of what the next hidden layer is computing.

229
00:07:42,013 --> 00:07:43,052
You probably have a hard time

230
00:07:44,018 --> 00:07:45,055
seeing what's going on, you know,

231
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:46,080
much beyond the first hidden layer,

232
00:07:47,063 --> 00:07:49,016
but then finally, all of

233
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:51,011
these learned features get

234
00:07:51,043 --> 00:07:52,058
fed to the output layer

235
00:07:53,025 --> 00:07:54,082
and shown over here is

236
00:07:55,002 --> 00:07:56,037
the final answers, the final

237
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,085
predictive value for what

238
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,014
handwritten digit the neural network things that is being shown.

239
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:04,026
So, let's take a look at the video.

240
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:44,037
So, I hope

241
00:09:50,061 --> 00:09:52,000
you enjoyed the video and that

242
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,048
this hopefully gave you some

243
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:55,024
intuition about the sorts

244
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:57,012
of pretty complicated functions neural

245
00:09:57,032 --> 00:09:58,041
networks can learn in which

246
00:09:58,074 --> 00:10:00,025
it takes this input this image,

247
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,050
just takes this input the

248
00:10:01,062 --> 00:10:03,013
raw pixels and the first

249
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,063
end of the layer computes some set

250
00:10:04,076 --> 00:10:05,067
of features, the next end

251
00:10:05,074 --> 00:10:06,089
of the layer computes even more complex

252
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:08,062
features and even more complex features

253
00:10:09,055 --> 00:10:10,063
and these features can then be

254
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,002
used by essentially the final

255
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:14,070
layer of logistic regression classifiers

256
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,054
to make accurate predictions about what

257
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:19,019
are the numbers that the network sees.
