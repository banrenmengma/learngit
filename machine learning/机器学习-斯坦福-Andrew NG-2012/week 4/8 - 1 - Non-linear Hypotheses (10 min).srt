1
00:00:00,044 --> 00:00:01,039
In this and in the

2
00:00:01,048 --> 00:00:02,064
next set of videos, I'd like

3
00:00:02,077 --> 00:00:04,026
to tell you about a learning

4
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:06,011
algorithm called a Neural Network.

5
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:07,090
We're going to first talk about

6
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:09,033
the representation and then

7
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:10,039
in the next set of videos

8
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:12,016
talk about learning algorithms for it.

9
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:14,007
Neutral networks is actually

10
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,086
a pretty old idea, but had

11
00:00:16,028 --> 00:00:17,067
fallen out of favor for a while.

12
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:19,026
But today, it is the

13
00:00:19,057 --> 00:00:20,082
state of the art technique for

14
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:22,039
many different machine learning problems.

15
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:25,073
So why do we need yet another learning algorithm?

16
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,003
We already have linear regression and

17
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:31,026
we have logistic regression, so why do we need, you know, neural networks?

18
00:00:32,028 --> 00:00:34,025
In order to motivate the discussion

19
00:00:34,078 --> 00:00:35,096
of neural networks, let me

20
00:00:36,011 --> 00:00:37,013
start by showing you a few

21
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:38,071
examples of machine learning

22
00:00:38,092 --> 00:00:40,010
problems where we need

23
00:00:40,029 --> 00:00:41,085
to learn complex non-linear hypotheses.

24
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,064
Consider a supervised learning classification

25
00:00:46,053 --> 00:00:48,043
problem where you have a training set like this.

26
00:00:49,028 --> 00:00:50,053
If you want to apply logistic

27
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:52,071
regression to this problem, one

28
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:54,025
thing you could do is apply

29
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:56,014
logistic regression with a

30
00:00:56,018 --> 00:00:57,071
lot of nonlinear features like that.

31
00:00:58,017 --> 00:00:59,057
So here, g as usual

32
00:01:00,007 --> 00:01:01,071
is the sigmoid function, and we

33
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:04,068
can include lots of polynomial terms like these.

34
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:06,079
And, if you include enough polynomial

35
00:01:07,037 --> 00:01:08,028
terms then, you know, maybe

36
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:10,028
you can get a hypotheses

37
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:13,078
that separates the positive and negative examples.

38
00:01:14,062 --> 00:01:16,007
This particular method works well

39
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:18,040
when you have only, say, two

40
00:01:18,062 --> 00:01:20,018
features - x1 and x2

41
00:01:20,018 --> 00:01:20,098
- because you can then include

42
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,087
all those polynomial terms of

43
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,062
x1 and x2.

44
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:26,028
But for many interesting machine learning

45
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:27,073
problems would have a

46
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,023
lot more features than just two.

47
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:31,076
We've been talking for a while

48
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:34,056
about housing prediction, and suppose

49
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,098
you have a housing classification

50
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:39,028
problem rather than a

51
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:41,017
regression problem, like maybe

52
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:43,034
if you have different features of

53
00:01:43,043 --> 00:01:44,076
a house, and you want

54
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,000
to predict what are the

55
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:47,059
odds that your house will

56
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,070
be sold within the next

57
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,004
six months, so that will be a classification problem.

58
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:53,006
And as we saw we can

59
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:55,012
come up with quite a

60
00:01:55,026 --> 00:01:56,048
lot of features, maybe a hundred

61
00:01:56,084 --> 00:01:58,026
different features of different houses.

62
00:02:00,012 --> 00:02:01,060
For a problem like this, if

63
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:03,026
you were to include all the

64
00:02:03,037 --> 00:02:04,098
quadratic terms, all of

65
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:06,026
these, even all of the

66
00:02:06,054 --> 00:02:07,054
quadratic that is the second

67
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:10,044
or the polynomial terms, there would be a lot of them.

68
00:02:10,056 --> 00:02:11,058
There would be terms like x1 squared,

69
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:17,061
x1x2, x1x3, you know, x1x4

70
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:21,087
up to x1x100 and then

71
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:23,062
you have x2 squared, x2x3

72
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:25,097
and so on.

73
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,077
And if you include just

74
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:29,019
the second order terms, that

75
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:30,075
is, the terms that are

76
00:02:30,084 --> 00:02:32,009
a product of, you know,

77
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:33,038
two of these terms, x1

78
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,000
times x1 and so on, then,

79
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:36,091
for the case of n equals

80
00:02:38,018 --> 00:02:40,028
100, you end up with about five thousand features.

81
00:02:41,088 --> 00:02:44,087
And, asymptotically, the

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,033
number of quadratic features grows

83
00:02:46,077 --> 00:02:48,066
roughly as order n

84
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:50,033
squared, where n is the

85
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:52,078
number of the original features,

86
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:54,078
like x1 through x100 that we had.

87
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:58,075
And its actually closer to n squared over two.

88
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:01,043
So including all the

89
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,091
quadratic features doesn't seem

90
00:03:03,021 --> 00:03:04,021
like it's maybe a good

91
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,037
idea, because that is a

92
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:07,005
lot of features and you

93
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,091
might up overfitting the training

94
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:10,050
set, and it can

95
00:03:10,074 --> 00:03:12,080
also be computationally expensive, you know, to

96
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:15,012
be working with that many features.

97
00:03:16,044 --> 00:03:17,053
One thing you could do is

98
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:19,009
include only a subset of

99
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:20,094
these, so if you include only the

100
00:03:21,005 --> 00:03:22,062
features x1 squared, x2 squared,

101
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:25,018
x3 squared, up to

102
00:03:25,058 --> 00:03:27,075
maybe x100 squared, then

103
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:29,050
the number of features is much smaller.

104
00:03:29,097 --> 00:03:31,071
Here you have only 100 such

105
00:03:32,006 --> 00:03:33,084
quadratic features, but this

106
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:35,094
is not enough features and

107
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:37,016
certainly won't let you fit

108
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:39,033
the data set like that on the upper left.

109
00:03:39,056 --> 00:03:40,055
In fact, if you include

110
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:42,071
only these quadratic features together

111
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:44,087
with the original x1, and

112
00:03:45,034 --> 00:03:46,050
so on, up to x100 features,

113
00:03:47,046 --> 00:03:48,053
then you can actually fit very

114
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,021
interesting hypotheses. So, you

115
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:52,034
can fit things like, you know, access a

116
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:53,086
line of the ellipses like these, but

117
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,024
you certainly cannot fit a more

118
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:57,093
complex data set like that shown here.

119
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:00,053
So 5000 features seems like

120
00:04:00,062 --> 00:04:03,009
a lot, if you were

121
00:04:03,022 --> 00:04:04,086
to include the cubic, or

122
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:06,009
third order known of each others,

123
00:04:06,043 --> 00:04:08,005
the x1, x2, x3.

124
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,080
You know, x1 squared,

125
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:12,024
x2, x10 and

126
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,028
x11, x17 and so on.

127
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:18,011
You can imagine there are gonna be a lot of these features.

128
00:04:19,004 --> 00:04:19,076
In fact, they are going to be

129
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:21,025
order and cube such features

130
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,082
and if any is 100

131
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,066
you can compute that, you

132
00:04:25,074 --> 00:04:26,087
end up with on the order

133
00:04:27,073 --> 00:04:29,064
of about 170,000 such cubic

134
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,067
features and so including

135
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:34,047
these higher auto-polynomial features when

136
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:36,005
your original feature set end

137
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:37,073
is large this really dramatically

138
00:04:38,052 --> 00:04:40,043
blows up your feature space and

139
00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:42,018
this doesn't seem like a

140
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,031
good way to come up with

141
00:04:43,056 --> 00:04:45,005
additional features with which

142
00:04:45,024 --> 00:04:48,010
to build none many classifiers when n is large.

143
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:52,056
For many machine learning problems, n will be pretty large.

144
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:53,056
Here's an example.

145
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,013
Let's consider the problem of computer vision.

146
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:00,076
And suppose you want to

147
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:02,062
use machine learning to train

148
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,061
a classifier to examine an

149
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,087
image and tell us whether

150
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:08,002
or not the image is a car.

151
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:11,089
Many people wonder why computer vision could be difficult.

152
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:13,013
I mean when you and I

153
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:15,067
look at this picture it is so obvious what this is.

154
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:17,000
You wonder how is it

155
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:18,031
that a learning algorithm could possibly

156
00:05:18,091 --> 00:05:20,087
fail to know what this picture is.

157
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:23,032
To understand why computer vision

158
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,037
is hard let's zoom

159
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:26,068
into a small part of the

160
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,018
image like that area where the

161
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,024
little red rectangle is.

162
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:31,032
It turns out that where you

163
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:34,026
and I see a car, the computer sees that.

164
00:05:34,077 --> 00:05:35,093
What it sees is this matrix,

165
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,011
or this grid, of pixel

166
00:05:38,057 --> 00:05:40,035
intensity values that tells

167
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:42,093
us the brightness of each pixel in the image.

168
00:05:43,063 --> 00:05:45,017
So the computer vision problem is

169
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:47,023
to look at this matrix of

170
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:49,013
pixel intensity values, and tell

171
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:52,043
us that these numbers represent the door handle of a car.

172
00:05:54,023 --> 00:05:55,074
Concretely, when we use

173
00:05:56,002 --> 00:05:57,022
machine learning to build a

174
00:05:57,043 --> 00:05:59,006
car detector, what we do

175
00:05:59,036 --> 00:06:00,050
is we come up with a

176
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,068
label training set, with, let's

177
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:04,025
say, a few label examples

178
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,085
of cars and a few

179
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,014
label examples of things that

180
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:08,077
are not cars, then we

181
00:06:09,008 --> 00:06:10,058
give our training set to

182
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:12,023
the learning algorithm trained a

183
00:06:12,031 --> 00:06:13,050
classifier and then, you

184
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:14,069
know, we may test it and show

185
00:06:14,088 --> 00:06:16,070
the new image and ask, "What is this new thing?".

186
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:20,002
And hopefully it will recognize that that is a car.

187
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:24,000
To understand why we

188
00:06:24,012 --> 00:06:26,081
need nonlinear hypotheses, let's take

189
00:06:27,005 --> 00:06:27,093
a look at some of the

190
00:06:28,018 --> 00:06:29,036
images of cars and maybe

191
00:06:29,048 --> 00:06:31,077
non-cars that we might feed to our learning algorithm.

192
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:33,092
Let's pick a couple of pixel

193
00:06:34,008 --> 00:06:35,062
locations in our images, so

194
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:37,004
that's pixel one location and

195
00:06:37,018 --> 00:06:39,050
pixel two location, and let's

196
00:06:39,073 --> 00:06:42,038
plot this car, you know, at the

197
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,000
location, at a certain

198
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,088
point, depending on the intensities

199
00:06:46,043 --> 00:06:47,087
of pixel one and pixel two.

200
00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:50,062
And let's do this with a few other images.

201
00:06:51,006 --> 00:06:52,044
So let's take a different example

202
00:06:52,098 --> 00:06:53,098
of the car and you know,

203
00:06:54,007 --> 00:06:55,000
look at the same two pixel locations

204
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,056
and that image has a

205
00:06:57,076 --> 00:06:58,097
different intensity for pixel one

206
00:06:59,023 --> 00:07:00,066
and a different intensity for pixel two.

207
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,093
So, it ends up at a different location on the figure.

208
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:05,074
And then let's plot some negative examples as well.

209
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:07,058
That's a non-car, that's a

210
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:09,047
non-car  .

211
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:10,091
And if we do this for

212
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:12,072
more and more examples using

213
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:14,068
the pluses to denote cars

214
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:16,031
and minuses to denote non-cars,

215
00:07:16,088 --> 00:07:18,050
what we'll find is that

216
00:07:18,082 --> 00:07:20,068
the cars and non-cars end up

217
00:07:20,088 --> 00:07:22,043
lying in different regions of

218
00:07:22,056 --> 00:07:24,091
the space, and what we

219
00:07:25,018 --> 00:07:26,056
need therefore is some sort

220
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:28,079
of non-linear hypotheses to try

221
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,089
to separate out the two classes.

222
00:07:32,048 --> 00:07:34,030
What is the dimension of the feature space?

223
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:38,020
Suppose we were to use just 50 by 50 pixel images.

224
00:07:38,076 --> 00:07:40,005
Now that suppose our images were

225
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:42,075
pretty small ones, just 50 pixels on the side.

226
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:44,099
Then we would have 2500 pixels,

227
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,064
and so the dimension of

228
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:49,031
our feature size will be N

229
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,044
equals 2500 where our feature

230
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:52,091
vector x is a list

231
00:07:53,018 --> 00:07:54,056
of all the pixel testings, you

232
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,068
know, the pixel brightness of pixel

233
00:07:57,007 --> 00:07:58,002
one, the brightness of pixel

234
00:07:58,032 --> 00:07:59,057
two, and so on down

235
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:01,031
to the pixel brightness of the

236
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,042
last pixel where, you know, in a

237
00:08:03,058 --> 00:08:05,044
typical computer representation, each of

238
00:08:05,054 --> 00:08:07,018
these may be values between say

239
00:08:07,048 --> 00:08:09,001
0 to 255 if it gives

240
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:12,011
us the grayscale value.

241
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:13,029
So we have n equals 2500,

242
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:15,057
and that's if we

243
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:17,013
were using grayscale images.

244
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,080
If we were using RGB

245
00:08:19,043 --> 00:08:21,013
images with separate red, green

246
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,087
and blue values, we would have n equals 7500.

247
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:28,062
So, if we were to

248
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,092
try to learn a nonlinear

249
00:08:30,037 --> 00:08:32,001
hypothesis by including all

250
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:33,071
the quadratic features, that is

251
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,067
all the terms of the form, you know,

252
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:38,089
Xi times Xj, while with the

253
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:40,037
2500 pixels we would end

254
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:42,050
up with a total of three million features.

255
00:08:43,004 --> 00:08:44,062
And that's just too large to

256
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:46,042
be reasonable; the computation would

257
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,067
be very expensive to find and

258
00:08:48,084 --> 00:08:50,007
to represent all of these

259
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,025
three million features per training example.

260
00:08:55,047 --> 00:08:57,058
So, simple logistic regression together

261
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,023
with adding in maybe the

262
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:00,050
quadratic or the cubic features

263
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:01,090
- that's just not a

264
00:09:01,098 --> 00:09:03,095
good way to learn complex

265
00:09:04,054 --> 00:09:06,009
nonlinear hypotheses when n

266
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,040
is large because you just end up with too many features.

267
00:09:09,037 --> 00:09:10,062
In the next few videos, I

268
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:11,088
would like to tell you about Neural

269
00:09:12,008 --> 00:09:13,066
Networks, which turns out

270
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:15,037
to be a much better way to

271
00:09:15,064 --> 00:09:17,072
learn complex hypotheses, complex nonlinear

272
00:09:17,096 --> 00:09:19,077
hypotheses even when your

273
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:22,008
input feature space, even when n is large.

274
00:09:22,086 --> 00:09:24,008
And along the way I'll

275
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,058
also get to show

276
00:09:25,077 --> 00:09:26,073
you a couple of fun videos

277
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,002
of historically important applications

278
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:31,028
of Neural networks as well that I

279
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,048
hope those videos that

280
00:09:33,057 --> 00:09:35,046
we'll see later will be fun for you to watch as well.
