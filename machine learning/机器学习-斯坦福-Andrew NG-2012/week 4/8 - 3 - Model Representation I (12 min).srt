1
00:00:00,078 --> 00:00:01,087
In this video, I want

2
00:00:02,006 --> 00:00:03,020
to start telling you about how

3
00:00:03,047 --> 00:00:04,096
we represent Neural Networks,

4
00:00:05,051 --> 00:00:06,069
in other words how we represent

5
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:08,013
our hypotheses or how

6
00:00:08,034 --> 00:00:11,026
we represent our model when using your Neural Networks.

7
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:13,075
Neural Networks were developed at

8
00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:17,064
simulating neurons or networks of neurons in the brain.

9
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:19,082
So, to explain the hypotheses

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,032
representation. Let's start by

11
00:00:22,057 --> 00:00:23,058
looking at what a single

12
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:25,025
neuron in the brain looks like.

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,062
Your brain and mine is jam-packed

14
00:00:28,016 --> 00:00:29,060
full of neurons like these

15
00:00:30,017 --> 00:00:31,030
and neurons are cells in

16
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:32,074
the brain and the two

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,074
things to draw attention to are

18
00:00:34,096 --> 00:00:36,059
that first that the

19
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,082
neuron has a cell body

20
00:00:38,035 --> 00:00:40,032
like so and moreover, the

21
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,047
neuron has a number of

22
00:00:41,067 --> 00:00:43,006
input wires and these are

23
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:44,035
called the dendrites who think of

24
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:47,036
them as input wires and

25
00:00:48,017 --> 00:00:49,050
these receive inputs from other

26
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:51,032
locations and the neuron

27
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,027
also has an output wire called the axon.

28
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:56,071
And this output wire

29
00:00:57,028 --> 00:00:58,090
is what it uses to send

30
00:00:59,014 --> 00:01:00,068
signal to other neurons

31
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:04,012
or to send messages to other neurons.

32
00:01:05,028 --> 00:01:07,021
So, at a simplistic level, what

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,073
a neuron is is a computational

34
00:01:09,043 --> 00:01:10,046
unit that gets a number

35
00:01:10,065 --> 00:01:13,021
of inputs through its input wires, does some computation.

36
00:01:14,043 --> 00:01:15,070
and then it sends outputs, via its

37
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:17,064
axon to other nodes

38
00:01:18,015 --> 00:01:19,054
or other neurons in the brain.

39
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:23,037
Here's an illustration of a group of neurons.

40
00:01:24,026 --> 00:01:25,034
The way that neurons communicate

41
00:01:26,012 --> 00:01:28,040
with each other is with little pulses of electricities.

42
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:31,081
They're also called spikes, but they're just means of little pulse of electricity.

43
00:01:33,014 --> 00:01:35,000
So, here's one neuron and what

44
00:01:35,068 --> 00:01:37,006
it does is if it

45
00:01:37,018 --> 00:01:38,026
wants to send a message,

46
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,028
what it does is it sends

47
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,018
the little pulse of electricity via its

48
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:44,010
axon to some difference

49
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:46,060
neuron and here this axon.

50
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:48,031
There is this open wire.

51
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:50,084
Connects to the input wire or

52
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:52,026
connects to the dendrite of this

53
00:01:52,054 --> 00:01:54,029
second neuron over here, which

54
00:01:54,056 --> 00:01:55,085
then accepts this incoming message

55
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:58,051
does some computation and may

56
00:01:58,071 --> 00:01:59,070
in turn decide to send

57
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:01,045
out its O messages on its

58
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:04,009
axon to other neurons.

59
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,073
And this is the process by

60
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:07,056
which all human thought

61
00:02:08,006 --> 00:02:09,053
happens as these neurons doing

62
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:11,015
computations and passing messages

63
00:02:11,062 --> 00:02:13,012
to other neurons as a

64
00:02:13,037 --> 00:02:15,056
result of what other inputs they've got.

65
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,056
And by the way, this is how

66
00:02:18,034 --> 00:02:21,003
our senses and our muscles work as well.

67
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:23,034
If you want to move one

68
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,046
of your muscles, the way that

69
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:26,011
works is that a neuron may

70
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:27,037
send these pulses of electricities

71
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:29,059
to your muscle and that causes

72
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:32,043
your muscles to contract and your

73
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:34,003
eyes - if some

74
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:35,050
sensor like your eye

75
00:02:35,065 --> 00:02:36,071
wants to send a message to

76
00:02:36,094 --> 00:02:37,081
your brain, what it does

77
00:02:38,036 --> 00:02:39,090
is it sends its pulses of

78
00:02:40,066 --> 00:02:42,066
electricity to a neuron in your brain like so.

79
00:02:43,046 --> 00:02:45,049
In a neural network, or

80
00:02:46,003 --> 00:02:47,069
rather in an artificial neural

81
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:49,025
network that we implement in

82
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:50,097
a computer, we're going to

83
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:52,056
use a very simple model

84
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:54,037
of what a neuron does.

85
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,071
We're going to model a neuron as just a logistic unit.

86
00:02:58,059 --> 00:02:59,047
So, when I draw a yellow

87
00:02:59,077 --> 00:03:01,012
circle like that, you should hink of

88
00:03:01,024 --> 00:03:03,012
that as playing a

89
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:04,071
role analogous to maybe the

90
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:06,047
body of a neuron, and

91
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,084
we then feed the neuron a

92
00:03:09,066 --> 00:03:11,066
few inputs via its dendrites or

93
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,015
its input wires and the neuron does some computation

94
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:19,005
and output some value on

95
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,025
this output wire or in

96
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:23,040
a biological neuron that sorts

97
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:25,015
the axon and whenever I

98
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:26,065
draw a diagram like this, what

99
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,002
this means is that this represents

100
00:03:28,055 --> 00:03:30,003
a computations of, you know, h of x equals 1

101
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,028
over 1 + e to

102
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:37,059
the negative theta transpose x where, as

103
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:39,033
usual, x and theta

104
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:42,061
are our parameter vectors like so.

105
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:44,040
So, this is a very simple maybe

106
00:03:44,078 --> 00:03:46,049
a vastly over simplified model of

107
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:48,005
the computation that the neuron

108
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:49,019
does where it gets the

109
00:03:49,025 --> 00:03:50,078
number of inputs, x1, x2,

110
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:54,015
x3 and it outputs some value computed like so.

111
00:03:59,096 --> 00:04:01,025
When I draw a neural network,

112
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,043
usually I draw only the

113
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:04,077
input nose x1, x2, x3,

114
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:07,074
sometimes when it's useful to do so.

115
00:04:08,016 --> 00:04:09,078
I draw an extra node for x zero.

116
00:04:11,005 --> 00:04:12,019
This x zero node is

117
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:13,096
sometimes called the bias unit

118
00:04:14,096 --> 00:04:17,097
or the bias neuron but because

119
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:21,035
x0 is already equal to 1.

120
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,031
Sometimes, I draw with it, sometimes

121
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:24,027
I won't just depending on whether

122
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,056
there's more the rotationally convenient for that example.

123
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:32,081
Finally, one last

124
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:34,080
bit of terminology when we

125
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:36,068
talk about neural networks, sometimes

126
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:38,050
we'll say that this

127
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,032
is a neuron - an

128
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:42,072
artificial neuron  with a sigmoid or a logistic

129
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:44,025
activation function.

130
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:48,002
So this activation function in the neuronetro

131
00:04:48,013 --> 00:04:49,019
terminology, this is just

132
00:04:49,054 --> 00:04:51,020
another term for that

133
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:53,018
function for that non-linearity g

134
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,017
of z, equals 1

135
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:56,001
over 1 plus e to the negative z.

136
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:58,041
And whereas so far

137
00:04:58,093 --> 00:05:00,008
I've been calling theta the parameters

138
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,050
of the model are mostly continued

139
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,079
to use that terminology to conjugate

140
00:05:05,048 --> 00:05:06,048
to the parameters, but the neural networks.

141
00:05:07,068 --> 00:05:08,095
In the neural networks literature and

142
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,029
sometimes you might hear people

143
00:05:10,062 --> 00:05:12,016
talk about weights of a

144
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:13,075
model and weights just means

145
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:15,049
exactly the same thing as

146
00:05:15,075 --> 00:05:17,047
parameters of the model.

147
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:18,088
But almost to use the terminology

148
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:21,000
parameters in these videos,

149
00:05:21,062 --> 00:05:24,018
but sometimes you may hear others use the weights terminology.

150
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:29,029
So, this little

151
00:05:29,043 --> 00:05:31,033
diagram represents a single neuron.

152
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:35,079
What a neural network is

153
00:05:36,056 --> 00:05:38,058
Is just a proof of

154
00:05:38,077 --> 00:05:40,050
these different neurons strung together.

155
00:05:41,062 --> 00:05:42,076
Concretely, here we have

156
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:45,006
input units x1, x2, and x3

157
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,017
and once again,

158
00:05:47,054 --> 00:05:49,006
sometimes can draw this

159
00:05:49,037 --> 00:05:50,075
extra node x0 or sometimes

160
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:52,049
not. So, I just draw that in here.

161
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:54,094
And here we have

162
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,080
three neurons, which I

163
00:05:56,093 --> 00:05:58,088
have written, you know, a(2)1, a(2)2 and

164
00:05:59,006 --> 00:06:00,025
a(2)3 around top bottles indices

165
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:02,013
later and once again,

166
00:06:02,073 --> 00:06:03,079
we can if we want

167
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,043
adding this a0 and

168
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:08,083
add an extra bias unit there.

169
00:06:10,024 --> 00:06:12,002
It always outputs the value of 1.

170
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,068
Then finally we have this

171
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:15,044
third node at the final

172
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,080
layer, and it's this

173
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:18,060
third node that opens the value

174
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,001
that the hypotheses h of x computes.

175
00:06:22,032 --> 00:06:23,048
To introduce a bit

176
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:25,025
more terminology in a neural

177
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,033
network, the first layer, this

178
00:06:27,048 --> 00:06:28,061
is also called the input

179
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:30,016
layer because this is where

180
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:33,050
we input our features, x1 x2 x3.

181
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:35,056
The final layer is

182
00:06:35,085 --> 00:06:37,018
also called the output layer

183
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,055
because that layer has

184
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,000
the neuron - this one over

185
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:42,033
here - that outputs the

186
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:43,098
final value computed by a

187
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,018
hypotheses and then layer

188
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:48,089
two in between, this is called the hidden layer.

189
00:06:49,082 --> 00:06:51,030
The term hidden layer isn't a

190
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:53,029
great terminology, but the

191
00:06:54,016 --> 00:06:55,068
intuition is that, you know, in

192
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:57,044
supervised learning where you

193
00:06:57,052 --> 00:06:59,081
get to see the inputs, and you get to see the correct outputs.

194
00:07:00,063 --> 00:07:02,052
Whereas the hidden layer are values you

195
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:04,025
don't get to observe in the training set.

196
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:07,027
If it's not x and it's not y and so we call those hidden.

197
00:07:08,017 --> 00:07:09,086
and later on we'll see neural

198
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:11,025
networks with more than

199
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:12,068
one hidden layer, but in

200
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:14,029
this example we have one

201
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:16,000
input layer, layer 1; one hidden

202
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:18,089
layer, layer 2; and one output layer, layer 3.

203
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,052
But basically anything that isn't

204
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,025
an input layer and isn't a

205
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,048
output layer is called a hidden layer.

206
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,062
So, I

207
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,061
want to be really clear

208
00:07:31,008 --> 00:07:33,012
about what this neural network is doing.

209
00:07:33,097 --> 00:07:34,083
Let's step through the computational

210
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:37,060
steps that are embodied

211
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:40,041
by this, represented by this diagram.

212
00:07:41,056 --> 00:07:42,080
To explain the specific computations

213
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:44,095
represented by a neural network,

214
00:07:45,057 --> 00:07:46,091
here's a little bit more notation.

215
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:48,039
I'm going to use a superscript

216
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:50,051
j subscript i to denote

217
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:53,063
the activation of neuron i

218
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,038
or of unit i in layer

219
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:58,029
j.  So concretely, this

220
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:01,027
a superscript 2 subscript 1

221
00:08:01,037 --> 00:08:03,093
does the activation of the

222
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,031
first unit in layer 2,

223
00:08:05,044 --> 00:08:07,013
in our hidden layer.

224
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:08,063
And by activation, I just mean,

225
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:10,036
you know, the value that is computed

226
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,052
by and that is output by a specific.

227
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:14,031
In addition, our neural network

228
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:17,005
is parametrized by these matrices,

229
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:19,051
theta superscript j where

230
00:08:19,068 --> 00:08:20,060
our theta j is going to

231
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:21,081
be a matrix of waves

232
00:08:22,013 --> 00:08:23,076
controlling the function mapping from

233
00:08:24,012 --> 00:08:25,077
one layer, maybe the first

234
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:28,036
layer to the second layer or from the second layer to the third layer.

235
00:08:29,057 --> 00:08:32,099
So, here are the computations that are represented by this diagram.

236
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:35,076
This first hidden unit here,

237
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:38,060
has its value computed as

238
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,001
follows: is a a(2)1 is

239
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:41,098
equal to the sigmoid

240
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,024
function, or the sigmoid activation function

241
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:46,054
also called the logistic activation function,

242
00:08:47,075 --> 00:08:49,073
applied to this sort

243
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:52,036
of linear combination of its inputs.

244
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:56,055
And then this second hidden

245
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:58,033
unit has this activation

246
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,039
value computed as sigmoid of this.

247
00:09:02,047 --> 00:09:04,011
And similarly, for this

248
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:07,000
third hidden unit, it's computed by that formula.

249
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:10,005
So here, we have three

250
00:09:10,077 --> 00:09:13,096
input units and the three hidden units.

251
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,084
And so the dimension

252
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,052
of theta one which the

253
00:09:22,005 --> 00:09:23,059
matrix of parameters governing our

254
00:09:23,074 --> 00:09:24,087
mapping from all three input

255
00:09:25,016 --> 00:09:26,052
units, about three hidden units

256
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:28,021
theta 1 is going to

257
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:35,038
be a 3,

258
00:09:35,063 --> 00:09:36,087
theta 1 is going to

259
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:39,063
be a 3 by 4 dimensional

260
00:09:40,064 --> 00:09:42,062
matrix and more generally,

261
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:45,044
if a network has Sj

262
00:09:45,071 --> 00:09:46,071
units and their j

263
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,044
and Sj + 1 units

264
00:09:48,064 --> 00:09:49,098
in their j + 1 then

265
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,070
the matrix theta j which

266
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,055
governs the function mapping from

267
00:09:53,077 --> 00:09:55,038
layer j to layer j +

268
00:09:55,063 --> 00:09:56,065
1 that we'll have to mention

269
00:09:57,027 --> 00:10:00,015
Sj + 1 by Sj + 1.

270
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,038
Just be clear about this notation, right?

271
00:10:02,058 --> 00:10:04,044
This is S subscript j

272
00:10:04,044 --> 00:10:05,080
+ 1 and that's S

273
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,025
subscript j, and then

274
00:10:07,037 --> 00:10:09,005
this whole thing, plus 1.

275
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,086
Of this whole thing, that's j + 1, okay?

276
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:13,073
So that's S subscript j plus

277
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:22,039
1 plus, by So,

278
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,009
that's S subscript j plus

279
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:26,023
1 by Sj

280
00:10:27,022 --> 00:10:30,046
+ 1 where as plus 1 is not part of the subscript.

281
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:33,051
So, we talked about what

282
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:36,012
the three hidden units do to compute their values.

283
00:10:37,017 --> 00:10:41,024
Finally, this last, the spinal in optimal

284
00:10:41,037 --> 00:10:42,027
layer, we have one more

285
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:44,026
units which computes h of

286
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:46,009
x and that's equal, can

287
00:10:46,023 --> 00:10:47,021
also be written as a(3)1

288
00:10:47,026 --> 00:10:50,083
and that's equal to this.

289
00:10:52,002 --> 00:10:53,011
And you notice that I've

290
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,048
written this with a superscript

291
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:56,037
2 here because theta superscript

292
00:10:57,012 --> 00:10:58,034
2 is the matrix of parameters,

293
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:01,016
or the matrix of weights that

294
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:02,083
controls the function that maps

295
00:11:03,024 --> 00:11:05,009
from the hidden units, that

296
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,085
is the layer 2 units,

297
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:09,023
to the 1 layer 3

298
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:10,084
unit that is the output

299
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:12,036
unit.

300
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:13,046
To summarize, what we've done

301
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,089
is shown how a picture

302
00:11:15,023 --> 00:11:16,066
like this over here defines

303
00:11:17,035 --> 00:11:20,027
an artificial neural network which defines

304
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:22,015
a function h that maps

305
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:24,087
your x's input values to hopefully

306
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:26,064
to some space and provisions y?

307
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,042
And these hypotheses after parametrized

308
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:31,060
by parameters that I

309
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:33,007
am denoting with a capital

310
00:11:33,046 --> 00:11:35,001
theta so that as

311
00:11:35,016 --> 00:11:36,091
we be vary theta we get different hypotheses.

312
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:38,092
So we get different functions mapping

313
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:42,049
say from x to y.  
So

314
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:44,000
this gives us a mathematical

315
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,098
definition of how to

316
00:11:46,013 --> 00:11:48,039
represent the hypotheses in the neural network.

317
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,075
In the next few videos, what

318
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,092
I'd like to do is give

319
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:53,058
you more intuition about what

320
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:56,027
these hypotheses representations do, as

321
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,028
well as go through a

322
00:11:57,037 --> 00:12:00,027
few examples and talk about how to compute them efficiently.
