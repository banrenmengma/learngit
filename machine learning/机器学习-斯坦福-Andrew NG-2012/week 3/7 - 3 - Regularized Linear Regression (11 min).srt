1
00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:01,049
For linear regression, we had

2
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:03,012
previously worked out two learning

3
00:00:03,049 --> 00:00:05,000
algorithms, one based on

4
00:00:05,017 --> 00:00:07,065
gradient descent and one based on the normal equation.

5
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,074
In this video we will take

6
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:11,064
those two algorithms and generalize

7
00:00:12,028 --> 00:00:13,038
them to the case of regularized

8
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:17,064
linear regression. Here's the

9
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,053
optimization objective, that we

10
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:22,037
came up with last time for regularized linear regression.

11
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:24,057
This first part is our

12
00:00:24,098 --> 00:00:27,023
usual, objective for linear regression,

13
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:29,030
and we now have this additional

14
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:31,075
regularization term, where londer

15
00:00:32,045 --> 00:00:34,096
is our regularization parameter, and

16
00:00:35,021 --> 00:00:36,068
we like to find parameters theta,

17
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:38,054
that minimizes this cost function,

18
00:00:39,003 --> 00:00:41,028
this regularized cost function, J of theta.

19
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:43,003
Previously, we were using

20
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,017
gradient descent for the original

21
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:48,006
cost function, without the regularization

22
00:00:48,077 --> 00:00:49,082
term, and we had

23
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:51,099
the following algorithm for regular

24
00:00:52,036 --> 00:00:53,061
linear regression, without regularization.

25
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:56,025
We will repeatedly update the

26
00:00:56,032 --> 00:00:57,067
parameters theta J as follows

27
00:00:58,027 --> 00:01:00,003
for J equals 1,2 up

28
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,010
through n. Let me

29
00:01:02,053 --> 00:01:03,096
take this and just write

30
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:06,057
the case for theta zero separately.

31
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,040
So, you know, I'm just gonna

32
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:09,090
write the update for theta

33
00:01:10,015 --> 00:01:12,050
zero separately, then for

34
00:01:12,068 --> 00:01:14,037
the update for the parameters

35
00:01:14,078 --> 00:01:17,009
1, 2, 3, and so on up

36
00:01:17,037 --> 00:01:19,076
to n. So, I haven't changed anything yet, right?

37
00:01:19,096 --> 00:01:21,006
This is just writing the update

38
00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:23,029
for theta zero separately from the

39
00:01:23,054 --> 00:01:25,023
updates from theta 1, theta

40
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,098
2, theta 3, up to theta n. And

41
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:27,090
the reason I want to do this

42
00:01:28,023 --> 00:01:29,031
is you may remember

43
00:01:29,087 --> 00:01:31,026
that for our regularized linear regression,

44
00:01:32,062 --> 00:01:33,096
we penalize the parameters theta

45
00:01:34,043 --> 00:01:35,054
1, theta 2, and so

46
00:01:35,085 --> 00:01:38,035
on up to theta n, but we don't penalize theta zero.

47
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:40,025
So when we modify this

48
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,040
algorithm for regularized

49
00:01:42,075 --> 00:01:44,004
linear regression, we're going to

50
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,087
end up treating theta zero slightly differently.

51
00:01:48,056 --> 00:01:50,035
Concretely, if we

52
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,017
want to take this algorithm and

53
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,078
modify it to use the

54
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:55,062
regularized objective, all we

55
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,017
need to do is take this

56
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,001
term at the bottom and modify as follows.

57
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:01,085
We're gonna take this term and add

58
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:05,031
minus londer M,

59
00:02:06,032 --> 00:02:08,091
times theta J. And

60
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,084
if you implement this, then you

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,022
have gradient descent for trying

62
00:02:13,096 --> 00:02:15,091
to minimize the regularized cost

63
00:02:16,015 --> 00:02:18,019
function J of F theta, and concretely,

64
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:20,056
I'm not gonna do the

65
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:22,025
calculus to prove it, but

66
00:02:22,038 --> 00:02:23,047
concretely if you look

67
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:26,058
at this term, this term that's written is square brackets.

68
00:02:27,072 --> 00:02:28,093
If you know calculus, it's possible

69
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:31,015
to prove that that term is

70
00:02:31,037 --> 00:02:33,015
the partial derivative, with respect of

71
00:02:33,097 --> 00:02:35,040
J of theta, using the new

72
00:02:35,065 --> 00:02:37,052
definition of J of theta

73
00:02:38,013 --> 00:02:39,033
with the regularization term.

74
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,049
And somebody on this

75
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:43,096
term up on top,

76
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:45,056
which I guess I am

77
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:47,024
drawing the salient box

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,027
that's still the partial derivative

79
00:02:49,093 --> 00:02:52,069
respect of theta zero for J of theta.

80
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:54,090
If you look at the update for

81
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:56,071
theta J, it's possible to

82
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,018
show's something pretty interesting, concretely

83
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:01,009
theta J gets updated as

84
00:03:01,028 --> 00:03:03,040
theta J, minus alpha times,

85
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:05,000
and then you have this other term

86
00:03:05,037 --> 00:03:06,072
here that depends on theta J

87
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,031
. So if you

88
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,040
group all the terms together

89
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:11,068
that depending on theta J. We

90
00:03:11,078 --> 00:03:13,018
can show that this update can

91
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:15,009
be written equivalently as

92
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:16,015
follows and all I did

93
00:03:16,046 --> 00:03:17,062
was have, you know, theta J

94
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,009
here is theta J times

95
00:03:20,044 --> 00:03:21,094
1 and this term is

96
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,083
londer over M. There's also an alpha

97
00:03:25,013 --> 00:03:25,099
here, so you end up

98
00:03:26,018 --> 00:03:27,065
with alpha londer over

99
00:03:27,096 --> 00:03:31,044
m, multiply them to

100
00:03:31,081 --> 00:03:33,065
theta J and this term here, one minus

101
00:03:34,022 --> 00:03:36,030
alpha times londer M, is

102
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:39,046
a pretty interesting term, it has a pretty interesting effect.

103
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:43,071
Concretely, this term one

104
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:45,031
minus alpha times londer over

105
00:03:45,072 --> 00:03:46,078
M, is going to be

106
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:48,074
a number that's, you know, usually a number

107
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,038
that's a loop and less than 1,

108
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:51,066
right? Because of

109
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:53,058
alpha times londer over M is

110
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:55,091
going to be positive and usually, if you're learning rate is small and M is large.

111
00:03:56,012 --> 00:03:57,066


112
00:03:58,065 --> 00:03:58,086
That's usually pretty small.

113
00:03:59,065 --> 00:04:00,068
So this term here, it's going

114
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:03,006
to be a number, it's usually, you know, a little bit less than one.

115
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,015
So think of it as

116
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:05,086
a number like 0.99, let's say

117
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:08,080
and so, the effect of our

118
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:10,055
updates of theta J is we're

119
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:11,094
going to say that theta J

120
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,041
gets replaced by thetata J times 0.99.

121
00:04:15,077 --> 00:04:17,050
Alright so theta J

122
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,093
times 0.99 has the effect of

123
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,056
shrinking theta J a little bit towards 0.

124
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:25,068
So this makes theta J a bit smaller.

125
00:04:26,022 --> 00:04:28,007
More formally, this you know, this

126
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:29,075
square norm of theta J

127
00:04:29,087 --> 00:04:31,057
is smaller and then

128
00:04:31,072 --> 00:04:33,043
after that the second

129
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:35,039
term here, that's actually

130
00:04:35,098 --> 00:04:37,093
exactly the same as the

131
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:40,026
original gradient descent updated that we had.

132
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:42,083
Before we added all this regularization stuff.

133
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:46,092
So, hopefully this gradient

134
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,062
descent, hopefully this update makes

135
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:51,035
sense, when we're using regularized linear

136
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:52,092
regression what we're doing is on

137
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:55,020
every regularization were multiplying data

138
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:56,031
J by a number that

139
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,030
is a little bit less than one, so

140
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:58,089
we're shrinking the parameter a

141
00:04:59,023 --> 00:05:00,033
little bit, and then we're

142
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,000
performing a, you know, similar update as before.

143
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:05,045
Of course that's just the

144
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:08,031
intuition behind what this particular update is doing.

145
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:10,012
Mathematically, what it's doing

146
00:05:10,057 --> 00:05:12,094
is exactly gradient descent on

147
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,032
the cost function J of theta

148
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,001
that we defined on the previous

149
00:05:16,048 --> 00:05:18,081
slide that uses the regularization term.

150
00:05:19,077 --> 00:05:21,020
Gradient descent was just

151
00:05:21,047 --> 00:05:23,005
one our two algorithms for

152
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:25,052
fitting a linear regression model.

153
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:28,008
The second algorithm was the

154
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:29,012
one based on the normal

155
00:05:29,068 --> 00:05:31,064
equation where, what we

156
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:32,098
did was we created the

157
00:05:33,006 --> 00:05:34,076
design matrix "x" where each

158
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:37,082
row corresponded to a separate training example.

159
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:39,079
And we created a vector

160
00:05:40,017 --> 00:05:41,077
Y, so this is

161
00:05:41,093 --> 00:05:43,031
a vector that is an

162
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:45,051
M dimensional vector and that

163
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,075
contain the labels from a training set.

164
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,060
So whereas X is an

165
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,066
M by N plus 1 dimensional matrix.

166
00:05:53,058 --> 00:05:55,022
Y is an M dimensional

167
00:05:55,077 --> 00:05:57,055
vector and in order

168
00:05:58,002 --> 00:05:59,019
to minimize the cost

169
00:05:59,047 --> 00:06:00,093
function change we found

170
00:06:01,047 --> 00:06:03,000
that of one way

171
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:04,043
to do is to set

172
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:06,079
theta to be equal to this.

173
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:09,004
We have X transpose X,

174
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:12,076
inverse X transpose Y.

175
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:13,092
I am leaving room here, to fill

176
00:06:14,012 --> 00:06:17,016
in stuff of course. And what this

177
00:06:17,064 --> 00:06:18,081
value for theta does, is

178
00:06:19,018 --> 00:06:20,098
this minimizes the cost

179
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:22,070
function J of theta when

180
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:26,027
we were not using regularization. Now

181
00:06:26,045 --> 00:06:28,057
that we are using regularization, if

182
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:30,029
you were to derive what the

183
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:31,081
minimum is, and just to

184
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,075
give you a sense of how to

185
00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:34,011
derive the minimum, the way

186
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:35,022
you derive it is you know,

187
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:37,091
take partial derivatives in respect

188
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:40,060
to each parameter, set this

189
00:06:40,082 --> 00:06:41,091
to zero, and then do

190
00:06:42,006 --> 00:06:42,092
a bunch of math, and you can

191
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,006
then show that is a formula

192
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:47,063
like this that minimizes the cost function.

193
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:52,012
And concretely, if you

194
00:06:52,024 --> 00:06:54,007
are using regularization then this

195
00:06:54,025 --> 00:06:56,031
formula changes as follows. Inside this

196
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:59,012
parenthesis, you end up with a matrix like this.

197
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:00,093
Zero, one, one, one

198
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,051
and so on, one until the bottom.

199
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,050
So this thing over here is

200
00:07:05,062 --> 00:07:07,081
a matrix, who's upper leftmost entry is zero.

201
00:07:08,056 --> 00:07:10,007
There's ones on the diagonals and

202
00:07:10,018 --> 00:07:11,095
then the zeros everywhere else on this matrix.

203
00:07:13,005 --> 00:07:14,001
Because I am drawing this a little bit sloppy.

204
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,079
But as a concrete

205
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:18,020
example if N equals 2,

206
00:07:19,008 --> 00:07:21,011
then this matrix

207
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,050
is going to be a three by three matrix.

208
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,020
More generally, this matrix is

209
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:27,066
a N plus one

210
00:07:28,026 --> 00:07:30,029
by N plus one dimensional matrix.

211
00:07:31,062 --> 00:07:33,014
So then N equals two then that

212
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:35,041
matrix becomes something that looks like this.

213
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:37,036
Zero, and then ones

214
00:07:37,063 --> 00:07:39,001
on the diagonals, and then

215
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:41,010
zeros on the rest of the diagonals.

216
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:43,099
And once again, you know, I'm not going to those this derivation.

217
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:46,027
Which is frankly somewhat long and involved.

218
00:07:46,062 --> 00:07:47,052
But it is possible to prove

219
00:07:47,097 --> 00:07:49,055
that if you are

220
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,076
using the new definition of

221
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:53,073
J of theta, with the regularization objective.

222
00:07:54,077 --> 00:07:56,006
Then this new formula for

223
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:57,018
theta is the one

224
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:00,007
that will give you the global minimum of J of theta.

225
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:02,045
So finally, I want to

226
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:05,045
just quickly describe the issue of non-invertibility.

227
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,011
This is relatively advanced material.

228
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,052
So you should consider this as

229
00:08:09,076 --> 00:08:11,060
optional and feel free

230
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:12,051
to skip it or if you

231
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:14,018
listen to it and you know, possibly it

232
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:15,068
don't really make sense, don't worry about it either.

233
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:18,094
But earlier when I talked the normal equation method.

234
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:20,092
We also had an optional video

235
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,095
on the non-invertability issue.

236
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,074
So this is another optional part,

237
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:27,006
that is sort of add on

238
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:30,010
earlier optional video on non-invertibility.

239
00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:33,035
Now considering setting where M

240
00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:35,034
the number of examples is less

241
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:37,052
than or equal to N the number features.

242
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:40,008
If you have fewer examples then

243
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,048
features then this matrix

244
00:08:42,016 --> 00:08:43,087
X transpose X will be

245
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:47,076
non-invertible or singular, or

246
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:50,012
the other term

247
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:51,047
for this is the matrix will

248
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:53,038
be degenerate and if

249
00:08:53,086 --> 00:08:54,077
you implement this in Octave

250
00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:56,037
anyway, and you use the

251
00:08:56,062 --> 00:08:58,057
P in function to take the psuedo inverse.

252
00:08:58,085 --> 00:08:59,079
It will kind of do the

253
00:09:00,008 --> 00:09:01,089
right thing that is not

254
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:03,045
clear that it will

255
00:09:03,055 --> 00:09:04,057
give you a very good hypothesis

256
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,072
even though numerically the octave

257
00:09:08,037 --> 00:09:09,066
P in function

258
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:11,004
will give you a result that

259
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:13,021
kind of makes sense.

260
00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:15,046
But, if you were doing this in a different language.

261
00:09:16,026 --> 00:09:17,059
And if you were

262
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:19,002
taking just the regular inverse

263
00:09:20,047 --> 00:09:22,007
which an octave is denoted with the function INV.

264
00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:24,000
We're trying to take the regular

265
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:25,062
inverse of X transpose X,

266
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:28,002
then in this setting you

267
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:30,034
find that X transpose X

268
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:32,075
is singular, is non-invertible and

269
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:33,074
if you're doing this in a different

270
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:35,083
programming language and using some

271
00:09:36,023 --> 00:09:39,015
linear algebra library try to take the inverse of this matrix.

272
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:41,008
It just might not work because that

273
00:09:41,022 --> 00:09:43,005
matrix is non-invertible or singular.

274
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:47,011
Fortunately, regularization also takes

275
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:49,085
care of this for us, and concretely, so

276
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,037
long as the regularization parameter is strictly greater than zero.

277
00:09:53,087 --> 00:09:55,022
It is actually possible to

278
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:56,084
prove that this matrix X

279
00:09:57,008 --> 00:09:58,069
transpose X plus parameter time, you know,s

280
00:09:59,008 --> 00:10:00,039
this funny matrix here,

281
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:02,025
is possible to prove that this

282
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:03,064
matrix will not be

283
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:05,071
singular and that this matrix will be invertible.

284
00:10:07,045 --> 00:10:09,042
So using regularization also takes

285
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,090
care of any non-invertibility issues

286
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:14,047
of the X transpose X matrix as well.

287
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:18,000
So, you now know how to implement regularize linear regression.

288
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:19,090
Using this, you'll be able

289
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:21,097
to avoid overfitting, even

290
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,072
if you have lots of features in a relatively small training set.

291
00:10:25,036 --> 00:10:26,062
And this should let you get

292
00:10:26,098 --> 00:10:29,000
linear regression to work much better for many problems.

293
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,019
In the next video, we'll take

294
00:10:31,038 --> 00:10:34,030
this regularization idea and apply it to logistic regression.

295
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:36,016
So that you'll be able to

296
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:37,062
get logistic impression to avoid

297
00:10:37,091 --> 00:10:39,083
overfitting and perform much better as well.
