1
00:00:00,036 --> 00:00:01,062
By now, you've seen a

2
00:00:01,076 --> 00:00:03,079
couple different learning algorithms, linear

3
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:05,032
regression and logistic regression.

4
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,066
They work well for many problems,

5
00:00:08,053 --> 00:00:09,050
but when you apply them

6
00:00:09,066 --> 00:00:11,075
to certain machine learning applications, they

7
00:00:11,088 --> 00:00:13,032
can run into a problem called

8
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,055
overfitting that can cause them to perform very poorly.

9
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:18,078
What I'd like to do in

10
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:20,023
this video is explain to

11
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,076
you what is this overfitting

12
00:00:22,037 --> 00:00:23,092
problem, and in the

13
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:25,019
next few videos after this,

14
00:00:25,082 --> 00:00:27,019
we'll talk about a technique called

15
00:00:27,076 --> 00:00:29,048
regularization, that will allow

16
00:00:29,078 --> 00:00:31,035
us to ameliorate or to

17
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:33,050
reduce this overfitting problem and

18
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,065
get these learning algorithms to maybe work much better.

19
00:00:36,085 --> 00:00:37,089
So what is overfitting?

20
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:41,017
Let's keep using our running

21
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:43,060
example of predicting housing

22
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:45,027
prices with linear regression

23
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:47,000
where we want to predict the

24
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:49,013
price as a function of the size of the house.

25
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:51,064
One thing we could do is

26
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,042
fit a linear function to

27
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:54,079
this data, and if we

28
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:55,085
do that, maybe we get

29
00:00:56,025 --> 00:00:57,078
that sort of straight line fit to the data.

30
00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:00,011
But this isn't a very good model.

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,021
Looking at the data, it seems

32
00:01:02,056 --> 00:01:03,089
pretty clear that as the

33
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:05,089
size of the housing freezes, the

34
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:08,012
housing prices plateau, or kind

35
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,085
of flattens out as we move to the right and so

36
00:01:11,073 --> 00:01:13,079
this algorithm does not

37
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:15,076
fit the training and we

38
00:01:15,085 --> 00:01:18,092
call this problem underfitting, and

39
00:01:19,018 --> 00:01:20,031
another term for this is

40
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,098
that this algorithm has high bias.

41
00:01:25,014 --> 00:01:26,057
Both of these roughly

42
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:29,073
mean that it's just not even fitting the training data very well.

43
00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:32,018
The term is kind of

44
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:33,090
a historical or technical one,

45
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:35,054
but the idea is that

46
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,018
if a fitting a straight line to

47
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:38,073
the data, then, it's as

48
00:01:38,092 --> 00:01:40,029
if the algorithm has a

49
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:42,050
very strong preconception, or a

50
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:44,028
very strong bias that housing

51
00:01:44,065 --> 00:01:45,076
prices are going to vary

52
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:49,045
linearly with their size and despite the data to the contrary.

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,021
Despite the evidence of the

54
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:53,079
contrary is preconceptions still

55
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,029
are bias, still closes

56
00:01:55,043 --> 00:01:56,035
it to fit a straight line

57
00:01:57,012 --> 00:01:59,009
and this ends up being a poor fit to the data.

58
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:02,004
Now, in the middle, we could

59
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,098
fit a quadratic functions enter and,

60
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,012
with this data set, we fit the

61
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:07,064
quadratic function, maybe, we get

62
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:09,055
that kind of curve

63
00:02:10,018 --> 00:02:14,006
and, that works pretty well.

64
00:02:14,028 --> 00:02:17,002
And, at the other extreme, would be if we were to fit, say a fourth other polynomial to the data.

65
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:18,075
So, here we have five parameters,

66
00:02:19,046 --> 00:02:23,012
theta zero through theta four,

67
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,084
and, with that, we can actually fill a curve

68
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,062
that process through all five of our training examples.

69
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:28,059
You might get a curve that looks like this.

70
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,027
That, on the one

71
00:02:32,046 --> 00:02:33,053
hand, seems to do

72
00:02:33,075 --> 00:02:34,096
a very good job fitting the

73
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:36,003
training set and, that is

74
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:37,069
processed through all of my data, at least.

75
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:40,009
But, this is still a very wiggly curve, right?

76
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,022
So, it's going up and down all

77
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:43,003
over the place, and, we don't actually

78
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:45,075
think that's such a good model for predicting housing prices.

79
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,074
So, this problem we

80
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,065
call overfitting, and, another

81
00:02:51,096 --> 00:02:52,094
term for this is that

82
00:02:53,016 --> 00:02:54,091
this algorithm has high variants.

83
00:02:57,088 --> 00:02:59,068
The term high variants is another

84
00:02:59,094 --> 00:03:01,050
sort of historical or technical one.

85
00:03:02,012 --> 00:03:03,028
But, the intuition is that,

86
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,087
if we're fitting such a high

87
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:06,087
order polynomial, then, the

88
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:08,044
hypothesis can fit, you know,

89
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,040
it's almost as if it can

90
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,058
fit almost any function and

91
00:03:11,096 --> 00:03:13,018
this face of possible hypothesis

92
00:03:14,012 --> 00:03:15,034
is just too large, it's too variable.

93
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:17,056
And we don't have enough data

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,011
to constrain it to give

95
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:21,093
us a good hypothesis so that's called overfitting.

96
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:23,093
And in the middle, there isn't really

97
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:26,015
a name but I'm just going to write, you know, just right.

98
00:03:26,096 --> 00:03:29,005
Where a second degree polynomial, quadratic function

99
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,038
seems to be just right for fitting this data.

100
00:03:32,053 --> 00:03:34,030
To recap a bit the

101
00:03:34,068 --> 00:03:36,055
problem of over fitting comes

102
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:38,012
when if we have

103
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:40,056
too many features, then to

104
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:43,002
learn hypothesis may fit the training side very well.

105
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:45,009
So, your cost function

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,096
may actually be very close

107
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:48,016
to zero or may be

108
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:50,055
even zero exactly, but you

109
00:03:50,075 --> 00:03:51,090
may then end up with a

110
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,075
curve like this that, you

111
00:03:53,084 --> 00:03:55,012
know tries too hard to

112
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,075
fit the training set, so that it

113
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:59,008
even fails to generalize to

114
00:03:59,025 --> 00:04:01,000
new examples and fails to

115
00:04:01,012 --> 00:04:02,047
predict prices on new examples

116
00:04:03,005 --> 00:04:04,022
as well, and here the

117
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:06,033
term generalized refers to

118
00:04:06,084 --> 00:04:10,012
how well a hypothesis applies even to new examples.

119
00:04:10,086 --> 00:04:12,009
That is to data to

120
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:14,033
houses that it has not seen in the data center.

121
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,068
On this slide, we looked at

122
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,070
over fitting for the case of linear regression.

123
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:23,088
A similar thing can apply to logistic regression as well.

124
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:25,066
Here is a logistic regression

125
00:04:26,006 --> 00:04:28,000
example with two features X1 and x2.

126
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,086
One thing we could do, is

127
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:31,043
fit logistic regression with

128
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:34,018
just a simple hypothesis like this,

129
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:36,082
where, as usual, G is my sigmoid function.

130
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:39,014
And if you do that, you end up

131
00:04:39,032 --> 00:04:41,004
with a hypothesis, trying to

132
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,080
use, maybe, just a straight

133
00:04:42,092 --> 00:04:44,056
line to separate the positive and the negative examples.

134
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:47,081
And this doesn't look like a very good fit to the hypothesis.

135
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,029
So, once again, this

136
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:51,087
is an example of underfitting

137
00:04:52,056 --> 00:04:54,043
or of the hypothesis having high bias.

138
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,031
In contrast, if you were

139
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:58,087
to add to your features

140
00:04:59,017 --> 00:05:00,074
these quadratic terms, then,

141
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:02,008
you could get a decision

142
00:05:02,055 --> 00:05:04,079
boundary that might look more like this.

143
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:07,019
And, you know, that's a pretty good fit to the data.

144
00:05:07,077 --> 00:05:10,050
Probably, about as

145
00:05:10,086 --> 00:05:12,052
good as we could get, on this training set.

146
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,005
And, finally, at the other

147
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:16,000
extreme, if you were to

148
00:05:16,013 --> 00:05:18,010
fit a very high-order polynomial, if

149
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,036
you were to generate lots of

150
00:05:19,097 --> 00:05:21,060
high-order polynomial terms of speeches,

151
00:05:22,049 --> 00:05:24,012
then, logistical regression may contort

152
00:05:24,075 --> 00:05:26,029
itself, may try really

153
00:05:26,056 --> 00:05:28,011
hard to find a

154
00:05:28,022 --> 00:05:31,044
decision boundary that fits

155
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,086
your training data or go

156
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:34,032
to great lengths to contort itself,

157
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:36,072
to fit every single training example well.

158
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:38,064
And, you know, if the

159
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,043
features X1 and

160
00:05:39,055 --> 00:05:41,022
X2 offer predicting, maybe,

161
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:43,012
the cancer to the,

162
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:45,070
you know, cancer is a malignant, benign breast tumors.

163
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:47,064
This doesn't, this really doesn't

164
00:05:47,094 --> 00:05:50,093
look like a very good hypothesis, for making predictions.

165
00:05:51,093 --> 00:05:53,033
And so, once again, this is

166
00:05:53,045 --> 00:05:54,074
an instance of overfitting

167
00:05:55,042 --> 00:05:56,079
and, of a hypothesis having

168
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,064
high variance and not really,

169
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,092
and, being unlikely to generalize well to new examples.

170
00:06:04,056 --> 00:06:06,001
Later, in this course, when we

171
00:06:06,013 --> 00:06:07,069
talk about debugging and diagnosing

172
00:06:08,045 --> 00:06:09,061
things that can go wrong with

173
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:11,029
learning algorithms, we'll give you

174
00:06:11,044 --> 00:06:12,058
specific tools to recognize

175
00:06:13,026 --> 00:06:14,060
when overfitting and, also,

176
00:06:14,093 --> 00:06:16,014
when underfitting may be occurring.

177
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:18,056
But, for now, lets talk about

178
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,025
the problem of, if we

179
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:21,036
think overfitting is occurring,

180
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:23,068
what can we do to address it?

181
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:26,024
In the previous examples, we had

182
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:28,043
one or two dimensional data so,

183
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:30,051
we could just plot the hypothesis and see what was going

184
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,051
on and select the appropriate degree polynomial.

185
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:36,038
So, earlier for the housing

186
00:06:36,077 --> 00:06:37,099
prices example, we could just

187
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,049
plot the hypothesis and, you

188
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,049
know, maybe see that it

189
00:06:41,056 --> 00:06:42,062
was fitting the sort of

190
00:06:42,076 --> 00:06:45,037
very wiggly function that goes all over the place to predict housing prices.

191
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,043
And we could then use figures

192
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,075
like these to select an appropriate degree polynomial.

193
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:53,088
So plotting the hypothesis, could

194
00:06:54,016 --> 00:06:55,018
be one way to try to

195
00:06:55,075 --> 00:06:57,036
decide what degree polynomial to use.

196
00:06:58,006 --> 00:06:59,061
But that doesn't always work.

197
00:07:00,018 --> 00:07:01,085
And, in fact more often we

198
00:07:01,097 --> 00:07:04,086
may have learning problems that where we just have a lot of features.

199
00:07:06,005 --> 00:07:07,020
And there is not

200
00:07:07,045 --> 00:07:09,062
just a matter of selecting what degree polynomial.

201
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,004
And, in fact, when we

202
00:07:12,017 --> 00:07:13,041
have so many features, it also

203
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:15,024
becomes much harder to plot

204
00:07:15,062 --> 00:07:17,036
the data and it becomes

205
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,094
much harder to visualize it,

206
00:07:19,013 --> 00:07:20,072
to decide what features to keep or not.

207
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,085
So concretely, if we're trying

208
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:27,044
predict housing prices sometimes we can just have a lot of different features.

209
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:30,062
And all of these features seem, you know, maybe they seem kind of useful.

210
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:32,043
But, if we have a

211
00:07:32,057 --> 00:07:33,080
lot of features, and, very little

212
00:07:34,006 --> 00:07:35,058
training data, then, over

213
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,012
fitting can become a problem.

214
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:38,098
In order to address over

215
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:40,038
fitting, there are two

216
00:07:40,063 --> 00:07:42,057
main options for things that we can do.

217
00:07:43,077 --> 00:07:45,058
The first option is, to try

218
00:07:45,076 --> 00:07:47,010
to reduce the number of features.

219
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,023
Concretely, one thing we

220
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:51,002
could do is manually look through

221
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:52,099
the list of features, and, use

222
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:54,050
that to try to decide which

223
00:07:54,086 --> 00:07:56,077
are the more important features, and, therefore,

224
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,023
which are the features we should

225
00:07:58,047 --> 00:08:00,066
keep, and, which are the features we should throw out.

226
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,011
Later in this course, where also

227
00:08:03,036 --> 00:08:05,007
talk about model selection algorithms.

228
00:08:06,004 --> 00:08:07,069
Which are algorithms for automatically

229
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:09,064
deciding which features

230
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,050
to keep and, which features to throw out.

231
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,087
This idea of reducing the

232
00:08:13,098 --> 00:08:15,026
number of features can work

233
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,093
well, and, can reduce over fitting.

234
00:08:17,085 --> 00:08:19,002
And, when we talk about model

235
00:08:19,036 --> 00:08:21,055
selection, we'll go into this in much greater depth.

236
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:24,011
But, the disadvantage is that, by

237
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,044
throwing away some of the

238
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,000
features, is also throwing

239
00:08:27,037 --> 00:08:29,080
away some of the information you have about the problem.

240
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:31,085
For example, maybe, all of

241
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,033
those features are actually useful

242
00:08:33,077 --> 00:08:35,004
for predicting the price of a

243
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:36,019
house, so, maybe, we don't actually

244
00:08:36,063 --> 00:08:37,058
want to throw some of

245
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:39,078
our information or throw some of our features away.

246
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,050
The second option, which we'll

247
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:45,077
talk about in the

248
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,033
next few videos, is regularization.

249
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:49,099
Here, we're going to keep

250
00:08:50,037 --> 00:08:52,040
all the features, but we're

251
00:08:52,055 --> 00:08:53,094
going to reduce the magnitude

252
00:08:54,096 --> 00:08:55,086
or the values of the parameters

253
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:58,052
theta J. And, this

254
00:08:58,075 --> 00:09:00,005
method works well, we'll see,

255
00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:01,067
when we have a lot of

256
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:03,012
features, each of which contributes

257
00:09:03,082 --> 00:09:04,080
a little bit to predicting

258
00:09:05,033 --> 00:09:07,057
the value of Y, like we

259
00:09:07,074 --> 00:09:09,055
saw in the housing price prediction example.

260
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:11,009
Where we could have a lot

261
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,051
of features, each of which

262
00:09:12,075 --> 00:09:15,040
are, you know, somewhat useful, so, maybe, we don't want to throw them away.

263
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:18,094
So, this subscribes the

264
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,078
idea of regularization at a very high level.

265
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:24,016
And, I realize that, all

266
00:09:24,036 --> 00:09:26,024
of these details probably don't make sense to you yet.

267
00:09:26,074 --> 00:09:28,007
But, in the next video, we'll

268
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:30,012
start to formulate exactly how

269
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:34,000
to apply regularization and, exactly what regularization means.

270
00:09:35,013 --> 00:09:36,058
And, then we'll start to

271
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:38,008
figure out, how to use this,

272
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,012
to make how learning algorithms work

273
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,083
well and avoid overfitting.
