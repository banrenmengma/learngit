1
00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:01,052
In this video we'll talk about

2
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:03,018
how to fit the parameters theta

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:04,070
for logistic regression.

4
00:00:05,087 --> 00:00:06,088
In particular, I'd like to

5
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:10,014
define the optimization objective or the

6
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,047
cost function that we'll use to fit the parameters.

7
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:16,076
Here's to supervised learning problem

8
00:00:17,037 --> 00:00:19,000
of fitting a logistic regression model.

9
00:00:19,096 --> 00:00:21,021
We have a training set

10
00:00:22,017 --> 00:00:23,057
of M training examples.

11
00:00:24,094 --> 00:00:26,046
And as usual each of

12
00:00:26,057 --> 00:00:28,012
our examples is represented by

13
00:00:28,014 --> 00:00:31,023
feature vector that's N plus 1 dimensional.

14
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:33,097
And as usual we have

15
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:36,015
X 0 equals 1.

16
00:00:36,043 --> 00:00:38,010
Our first feature, or our 0

17
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:39,068
feature is always equal to 1,

18
00:00:39,096 --> 00:00:41,007
and because this is a

19
00:00:41,017 --> 00:00:42,092
classification problem, our training

20
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:44,063
set has the property that

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,072
every label Y, is either 0 or 1.

22
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,072
This is a hypothesis

23
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:51,089
and the parameters of the

24
00:00:51,096 --> 00:00:54,006
hypothesis is this theta over here.

25
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:55,047
And the question I want

26
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,017
to talk about is given this

27
00:00:57,034 --> 00:00:58,079
training set how do

28
00:00:58,088 --> 00:01:01,018
we choose, or how do we fit the parameters theta?

29
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,090
Back when we were developing the

30
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,090
linear regression model, we use the following cost function.

31
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:09,093
I've written this slightly differently, where

32
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,051
instead of 1/2m, I've

33
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:15,023
taken the 1/2 and put it inside the summation instead.

34
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,023
Now, I want to use

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,084
an alternative way of writing

36
00:01:19,014 --> 00:01:20,054
out this cost function which is

37
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,084
that instead of writing out

38
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:23,012
this squared and return here,

39
00:01:23,092 --> 00:01:27,009
let's write here, cost of

40
00:01:28,031 --> 00:01:31,003
H of X comma

41
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,018
Y, and I'm going

42
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,050
to define that term cost

43
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,042
of H of X comma Y to be equal to this.

44
00:01:39,073 --> 00:01:41,057
It's just equal to just one half of the square root error.

45
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:43,059
So now, we can see more

46
00:01:43,073 --> 00:01:45,068
clearly that the cost

47
00:01:45,098 --> 00:01:47,012
function is a sum

48
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,070
over my training set, or

49
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:51,012
is 1/m times the sum

50
00:01:51,037 --> 00:01:54,037
over my training set of this cost term here.

51
00:01:56,004 --> 00:01:57,084
And to simplify this

52
00:01:58,004 --> 00:01:59,046
equation a little bit more, it's gonna

53
00:01:59,048 --> 00:02:01,028
be convenient to get rid of those superscripts.

54
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,026
So just define cost of

55
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:05,042
H of X comma Y to

56
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:06,048
be equal to 1/2 of

57
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,050
this square root error  and the

58
00:02:08,091 --> 00:02:09,088
interpretation of this cost function

59
00:02:10,036 --> 00:02:11,080
is that this is the

60
00:02:11,088 --> 00:02:13,013
cost I want my learning

61
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:14,090
algorithm to, you know,

62
00:02:15,006 --> 00:02:16,043
have to pay, if it

63
00:02:16,075 --> 00:02:18,062
outputs that value it

64
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:19,081
this prediction is H of

65
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:20,091
X, and the actual

66
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:23,081
label was Y. So just

67
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:26,075
cross off those superscripts. All right.

68
00:02:27,084 --> 00:02:29,050
And no surprise for linear

69
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:31,043
regression the cost for you to define is that.

70
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:32,044
Well the cost for this

71
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:34,012
is, that is 1/2

72
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,074
times the square difference

73
00:02:36,018 --> 00:02:37,050
between what are predicted and the

74
00:02:37,066 --> 00:02:38,059
actual value that we observe

75
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:40,078
for Y. Now, this cost

76
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:42,050
function worked fine for linear

77
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:46,008
regression, but here we're interested in logistic regression.

78
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:48,087
If we could minimize this cost

79
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:51,009
function that is plugged into J here.

80
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:52,071
That will work okay.

81
00:02:53,078 --> 00:02:55,022
But it turns out that if

82
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:57,000
we use this particular cost function

83
00:02:57,062 --> 00:03:00,069
this would be a non-convex function of the parameters theta.

84
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,062
Here's what I mean by non-convex.

85
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,015
We have some cost function J

86
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:07,018
of theta, and for logistic

87
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:10,056
regression this function H here

88
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:13,028
has a non linearity, right?

89
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,040
It says, you know, 1 over

90
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,080
1 plus E to the negative theta transfers

91
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:18,033
X. So it's a pretty complicated nonlinear function.

92
00:03:19,058 --> 00:03:20,077
And if you take the sigmoid

93
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:21,091
function and plug it in

94
00:03:22,006 --> 00:03:23,006
here and then take

95
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,074
this cost function and plug

96
00:03:25,002 --> 00:03:26,030
it in there, and then plot

97
00:03:26,071 --> 00:03:27,096
what J of theta looks

98
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:29,044
like, you find that

99
00:03:29,062 --> 00:03:32,013
J of theta can look like a function just like this.

100
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,062
You know with many local optima and

101
00:03:35,093 --> 00:03:37,006
the formal term for this

102
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:38,094
is that this a non convex function.

103
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,046
And you can kind of tell.

104
00:03:40,062 --> 00:03:41,044
If you were to run gradient

105
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,090
descent on this sort of

106
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,036
function, it is not guaranteed

107
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,043
to converge to the global minimum.

108
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,075
Whereas in contrast, what

109
00:03:48,087 --> 00:03:49,091
we would like is to have

110
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:51,030
a cost function J of theta

111
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:53,043
that is convex, that is

112
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:55,005
a single bow-shaped function that

113
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,046
looks like this, so that

114
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:58,038
if you run gradient descent, we

115
00:03:58,053 --> 00:04:00,003
would be guaranteed that gradient descent, you know,

116
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:03,081
would converge to the global minimum.

117
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,059
And the problem of using the

118
00:04:07,002 --> 00:04:08,025
the square cost function is that

119
00:04:08,052 --> 00:04:10,016
because of this very

120
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,011
non linear sigmoid function that

121
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:14,000
appears in the middle here, J of

122
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:15,068
theta ends up being

123
00:04:15,096 --> 00:04:17,087
a non convex function if you

124
00:04:17,093 --> 00:04:19,091
were to define it as the square cost function.

125
00:04:21,025 --> 00:04:21,095
So what we'd would like to do

126
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:23,052
is to instead come up with

127
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,032
a different cost function that

128
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:27,074
is convex and so

129
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:28,094
that we can apply a great

130
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:30,035
algorithm like gradient descent

131
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:32,073
and be guaranteed to find a global minimum.

132
00:04:33,063 --> 00:04:36,007
Here's a cost function that we're going to use for logistic regression.

133
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:38,038
We're going to say the cost

134
00:04:39,031 --> 00:04:40,031
or the penalty that the algorithm

135
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:42,074
pays if it outputs

136
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:44,012
a value H of X.

137
00:04:44,062 --> 00:04:46,043
So, this is some number like 0.7

138
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:48,047
where it predicts a value H

139
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:50,014
of X. And the actual

140
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:51,093
cost label turns out to

141
00:04:52,002 --> 00:04:53,098
be Y. The cost is

142
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:55,080
going to be minus log

143
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,060
H of X if Y is equal 1.

144
00:04:57,086 --> 00:04:59,013
And minus log, 1 minus

145
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:01,057
H of X if Y is equal to 0.

146
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,079
This looks like a pretty complicated function.

147
00:05:04,023 --> 00:05:05,062
But let's plot function to

148
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:07,043
gain some intuition about what it's doing.

149
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,067
Let's start up with the case of Y equals 1.

150
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:12,000
If Y is equal equal

151
00:05:12,043 --> 00:05:13,062
to 1, then the cost function

152
00:05:14,082 --> 00:05:18,004
is -log H of X, and

153
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,033
if we plot that, so let's

154
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:20,098
say that the horizontal

155
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:22,069
axis is H of X.

156
00:05:22,092 --> 00:05:24,023
So we know that a hypothesis

157
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,094
is going to output a value between

158
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:27,064
0 and 1.

159
00:05:28,006 --> 00:05:28,006
Right?

160
00:05:28,049 --> 00:05:29,093
So H of X that varies

161
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:31,050
between 0 and 1.

162
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:34,050
If you plot what this cost function looks like.

163
00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:36,072
You find that it looks like this.

164
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:38,086
One way to see why the

165
00:05:38,095 --> 00:05:40,020
plot like this it is because

166
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:43,044
if you were to plot log Z

167
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,061
with Z on the horizontal axis.

168
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:48,041
Then that looks like that.

169
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:49,080
And it's approach is minus infinity.

170
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:52,087
So this is what the log function looks like.

171
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:55,024
And so this is 0, this is 1.

172
00:05:55,098 --> 00:05:57,036
Here Z is of

173
00:05:57,047 --> 00:05:58,069
course playing the row of

174
00:05:59,064 --> 00:06:01,039
H of X.  And so

175
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:04,056
minus log Z will look like this.

176
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,016
Right just flipping the sign.

177
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,052
Minus log Z. And we're

178
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,086
interested only in the

179
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:12,018
range of when this function

180
00:06:12,061 --> 00:06:13,082
goes between 0 and 1.

181
00:06:13,095 --> 00:06:14,074
So, get rid of that.

182
00:06:15,092 --> 00:06:17,006
And so, we're just left with,

183
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:18,093
you know, this part of the curve.

184
00:06:21,062 --> 00:06:22,037
And that's what this curve on the left looks like.

185
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,098
Now this cost function

186
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,042
has a few interesting and desirable properties.

187
00:06:29,068 --> 00:06:31,057
First you notice that if

188
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:34,085
Y is equal to 1 and H of X is equal 1, in

189
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,066
other words, if the hypothesis

190
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,039
exactly, you know, predicts

191
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:40,000
H equals 1, and Y

192
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,095
is exactly equal to what I predicted.

193
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:43,093
Then the cost is equal 0.

194
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:44,017
Right?

195
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:47,025
That corresponds to, the curve doesn't actually flatten out.

196
00:06:47,044 --> 00:06:49,038
The curve is still going. First, notice

197
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,075
that if H of X

198
00:06:50,097 --> 00:06:52,020
equals 1, if the hypothesis

199
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:54,093
predicts that Y is equal to 1.

200
00:06:55,006 --> 00:06:56,025
And if indeed Y is

201
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:58,041
equal to 1 then the cost is equal to 0.

202
00:06:58,052 --> 00:07:00,056
That corresponds to this point down here.

203
00:07:00,082 --> 00:07:00,082
Right?

204
00:07:01,002 --> 00:07:01,083
If H of X is equal

205
00:07:02,032 --> 00:07:03,052
to 1, and we're only

206
00:07:04,002 --> 00:07:05,051
concerned the case that Y equals 1 here.

207
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:08,012
But if H of X is equal to 1.

208
00:07:08,035 --> 00:07:10,093
Then the cost is down here is equal to 0.

209
00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:12,079
And that is what we like it to be.

210
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:13,082
Because, you know, if we

211
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:17,055
correctly predict the output Y then the cost is 0.

212
00:07:17,064 --> 00:07:19,081
But now, notice

213
00:07:21,047 --> 00:07:23,037
that H of X approaches 0.

214
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,093
So, that's H. As the

215
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:26,074
output of the hypothesis approaches 0

216
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,041
the cost blows up, and it goes to infinity.

217
00:07:30,013 --> 00:07:31,036
And what this does is

218
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,081
it captures the intuition that if

219
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:36,068
a hypothesis, you know, outputs 0.

220
00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:38,038
That's like saying, our hypothesis is

221
00:07:38,056 --> 00:07:39,075
saying, the chance of Y

222
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,027
equals 1 is equal to 0.

223
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:42,026
It's kind of like our going

224
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:43,077
to our medical patient and saying,

225
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:45,041
"The probability that you

226
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:47,002
have a malignant tumor, the

227
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:48,069
probability that Y equals 1 is zero."

228
00:07:49,085 --> 00:07:51,097
So, it's like absolutely impossible that your

229
00:07:52,016 --> 00:07:53,069
tumor is malignant.

230
00:07:55,014 --> 00:07:56,052
But if it turns out that

231
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:59,044
the tumor, the patient's tumor, actually is malignant.

232
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,070
So if Y is equal to

233
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:03,002
1 even after we told them

234
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,016
you know, the probability of it happening is 0.

235
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:07,047
It's absolutely impossible for it to be malignant.

236
00:08:08,064 --> 00:08:09,058
But if we told them

237
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:10,093
this with that level of certainty,

238
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,007
and we turn out to be wrong,

239
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,035
then we penalize the learning algorithm

240
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:15,062
by a very, very large cost,

241
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:17,081
and that's captured by having this

242
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:20,029
cost goes infinity if Y

243
00:08:20,044 --> 00:08:21,069
equals 1 and H

244
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:23,055
of X approaches 0.

245
00:08:24,032 --> 00:08:26,050
This might consider of

246
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:28,066
Y1, let's look at what

247
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:30,031
the cost function looks like for Y0.

248
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,048
If Y is equal to 0, then the cost

249
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:38,005
looks like this expression over here.

250
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:40,004
And if you plot

251
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,028
the function minus log 1

252
00:08:42,077 --> 00:08:45,066
minus Z what you

253
00:08:45,082 --> 00:08:48,023
get is the cost function actually looks like this.

254
00:08:49,024 --> 00:08:50,000
So, it goes from 0 to 1.

255
00:08:50,026 --> 00:08:51,050
Something like that.

256
00:08:53,027 --> 00:08:54,014
And so if you plot

257
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,058
the cost function for the case

258
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:57,066
of y equals zero, you find that it looks

259
00:08:57,076 --> 00:09:00,000
like this and what

260
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:02,022
this curve does is it

261
00:09:02,038 --> 00:09:04,062
now blows up,

262
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:07,072
and it goes to plus infinity as H of X goes to 1.

263
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:09,064
Because it's saying that

264
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:10,083
if Y turns out to be

265
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,002
equal to 0, but we

266
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:13,069
predicted that you know, Y is

267
00:09:13,096 --> 00:09:15,000
equal to 1 with almost

268
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:17,001
certainty with probability 1, then

269
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:18,060
we end up paying a very large cost.

270
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:22,099
Let's plot the cost function for

271
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:24,074
the case of Y equals 0.

272
00:09:25,003 --> 00:09:28,000
So if Y equals 0 that's going to be our cost function.

273
00:09:29,066 --> 00:09:31,012
If you look at this expression,

274
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,045
and if you plot, you know, minus

275
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,096
log 1 minus Z, if

276
00:09:36,022 --> 00:09:37,009
you figure out what that looks like,

277
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,080
you get a figure that looks like this.

278
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:41,029
Where, which goes from 0

279
00:09:41,067 --> 00:09:42,098
to 1 with the Z

280
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,064
axis on the horizontal axis.

281
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:46,096
So If you take this cost

282
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,028
function and plot it for

283
00:09:48,032 --> 00:09:49,042
the case of Y equals 0,

284
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,090
what you get is

285
00:09:51,013 --> 00:09:53,074
that the cost function looks like this.

286
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:56,022
And what this cost function

287
00:09:56,072 --> 00:09:58,041
does is that it blows

288
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,052
up or it goes to a

289
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:01,030
positive infinity as each

290
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,039
H of X goes to one

291
00:10:03,071 --> 00:10:05,009
and this captures the

292
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,078
intuition that if a hypothesis

293
00:10:07,017 --> 00:10:08,074
predicted that, you know, H of

294
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:09,096
X is equal to 1 with

295
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,086
certainty, with like probability 1,

296
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,096
it's absolutely got to be Y equals 1.

297
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:15,044
But if Y turned out to

298
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,064
be equal to 0 then

299
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,012
it makes sense to make the

300
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:20,071
hypothesis, or make the learning algorithm pay a very large cost.

301
00:10:21,094 --> 00:10:24,044
And conversely, if H

302
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:25,064
of X is equal to

303
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:26,092
0 and Y equals zero,

304
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:28,083
then the hypothesis nailed it.

305
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,035
The predicted Y is equal

306
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,011
to zero and it turns

307
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:33,052
out Y is equal to zero

308
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:35,084
so at this point the cost

309
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:38,097
function is going to be 0.

310
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:42,003
In this video, we

311
00:10:42,014 --> 00:10:43,040
have defined the cost function

312
00:10:43,087 --> 00:10:45,009
for a single training example.

313
00:10:46,032 --> 00:10:49,059
The topic of convexity analysis is beyond the scope of this course.

314
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:51,021
But it is possible to show

315
00:10:51,062 --> 00:10:52,085
that with our particular choice

316
00:10:53,014 --> 00:10:54,059
of cost function this would

317
00:10:54,073 --> 00:10:56,064
give us a convex optimization problem

318
00:10:57,096 --> 00:10:59,062
as cost function, overall cost function

319
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:01,034
J of theta will be

320
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:03,023
convex and local optima free.

321
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:05,062
In the next video we're going

322
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:07,060
to take these ideas of the

323
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:08,060
cost function for a single

324
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,047
training example and develop that

325
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,023
further and define the

326
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,041
cost function for the entire

327
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:15,032
training set, and we'll also

328
00:11:16,004 --> 00:11:17,022
figure out a simpler way to

329
00:11:17,038 --> 00:11:18,092
write it than we have been using so far.

330
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:20,076
And based on that will

331
00:11:21,002 --> 00:11:22,061
work out gradient descent, and

332
00:11:22,075 --> 00:11:24,062
that will give us our logistic regression algorithm.
