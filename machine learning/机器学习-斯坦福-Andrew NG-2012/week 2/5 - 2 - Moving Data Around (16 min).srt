00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:02,628
In this second tutorial video on

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:03,904
Octave, I'd like to start

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,322
to tell you how to move data around in Octave.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,783
So, if you have data for

5
00:00:08,783 --> 00:00:12,125
a machine learning problem, how do you load that data in Octave?

6
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:13,693
How do you put it into matrix?

7
00:00:13,693 --> 00:00:15,284
How do you manipulate these matrices?

8
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,982
How do you save the results?

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,185
How do you move data around and operate with data?

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,044
Here's my Octave window as

11
00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:29,256
before, picking up from where we left off in the last video.

12
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,132
If I type A, that's

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,258
the matrix so we generate it, right,

14
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:35,197
with this command equals one, two,

15
00:00:35,197 --> 00:00:38,152
three, four, five, six, and

16
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,696
this is a three by two matrix.

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,415
The size command in Octave

18
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,361
lets you, tells you what is the size of a matrix.

19
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:48,207
So size A returns three, two.

20
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:50,160
It turns out that

21
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,155
this size command itself is actually

22
00:00:52,155 --> 00:00:54,591
returning a one by two matrix.

23
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:56,598
So you can actually set SZ equals

24
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,370
size of A and SZ

25
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,597
is now a one by two

26
00:00:59,597 --> 00:01:01,627
matrix where the first element

27
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,689
of this is three, and the second element of this is two.

28
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,494
So, if you just type size of SZ. Does SZ

29
00:01:07,494 --> 00:01:08,898
is a one by

30
00:01:08,898 --> 00:01:10,862
two matrix whose two elements

31
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,721
contain the dimensions of the

32
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:15,279
matrix A. You can

33
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:17,787
also type size A one

34
00:01:17,787 --> 00:01:19,505
to give you back the first

35
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,542
dimension of A, size

36
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:22,662
of the first dimension of A.

37
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,108
So that's the number

38
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,307
of rows and size A two

39
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,361
to give you back two, which

40
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:29,598
is the number of columns in

41
00:01:29,598 --> 00:01:31,942
the matrix A. 
If you

42
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,034
have a vector V, so

43
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:36,016
let's say V equals one, two,

44
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,089
three, four, and you

45
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:40,830
type length V.  What

46
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,097
this does is it gives you

47
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:44,123
the size of the longest dimension.

48
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,609
So you can also type

49
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:48,487
length A and because

50
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,856
A is a three by

51
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,305
two matrix, the longer

52
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,825
dimension is of size

53
00:01:53,825 --> 00:01:56,145
three, so this should print out three.

54
00:01:56,145 --> 00:01:58,805
But usually we apply length only to vectors.

55
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,194
So you know, length one, two,

56
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,222
three, four, five, rather

57
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,010
than apply length to matrices

58
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,205
because that's a little more confusing.

59
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,122
Now, let's look

60
00:02:10,122 --> 00:02:11,843
at how the load data and

61
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,732
find data on the file system.

62
00:02:13,732 --> 00:02:15,254
When we start an Octave

63
00:02:15,254 --> 00:02:16,882
we're usually, we're often in

64
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,098
a path that

65
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:21,738
is, you know, the location of where the Octave location is.

66
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,042
So the PWD command shows

67
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,619
the current directory, or the

68
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,738
current path that Octave is in.

69
00:02:28,738 --> 00:02:31,932
So right now we're in this maybe somewhat off scale directory.

70
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:33,999
The CD command stands

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,322
for change directory, so I

72
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,681
can go to C:/Users/Ang/Desktop, and

73
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:43,657
now I'm in, you know, in my Desktop

74
00:02:43,657 --> 00:02:45,925
and if I type ls,

75
00:02:45,925 --> 00:02:49,447
ls is, it comes from a Unix or a Linux command.

76
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:50,648
But, ls will list the

77
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:52,435
directories on my desktop and

78
00:02:52,435 --> 00:02:54,137
so these are the files

79
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,184
that are on my Desktop right now.

80
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,838
In fact, on my desktop are

81
00:03:17,838 --> 00:03:19,920
two files: Features X and

82
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,689
Price Y that's maybe come

83
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:23,596
from a machine learning problem I want to solve.

84
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,830
So, here's my desktop.

85
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,144
Here's Features X, and

86
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:31,598
Features X is this window,

87
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,492
excuse me, is this file with two columns of data.

88
00:03:34,492 --> 00:03:36,702
This is actually my housing prices data.

89
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,374
So I think, you know, I

90
00:03:38,374 --> 00:03:40,652
think I have forty-seven rows in this data set.

91
00:03:40,652 --> 00:03:42,344
And so the first house

92
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,966
has size two hundred four

93
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,172
square feet, has three bedrooms; second

94
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,367
house has sixteen hundred square

95
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:49,862
feet, has three bedrooms; and so on.

96
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,302
And Price Y is this

97
00:03:52,302 --> 00:03:55,020
file that has

98
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,575
the prices of the data in my training set.

99
00:03:57,575 --> 00:03:59,735
So, Features X and

100
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:03,061
Price Y are just text files with my data.

101
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:04,770
How do I load this data into Octave?

102
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,050
Well, I just type

103
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,163
the command load Features X dot

104
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:10,069
dat and if I

105
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:11,991
do that, I load the Features X

106
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:15,772
and can load Price Y dot dat. And

107
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:17,323
by the way, there are multiple ways to do this.

108
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,245
This command if you put

109
00:04:19,245 --> 00:04:20,916
Features X dot dat on that

110
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,533
in strings and load it like so.

111
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,477
This is a typo there.

112
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,317
This is an equivalent command.

113
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:29,334
So you can, this

114
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,985
way I'm just putting the file name of the string

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,148
in the founding in a

116
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,716
string and in an

117
00:04:35,716 --> 00:04:38,902
Octave use single quotes to

118
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,876
represent strings, like so.

119
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:42,837
So that's a string, and we

120
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,517
can load the file

121
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:48,324
whose name is given by that string.

122
00:04:48,324 --> 00:04:50,919
Now the WHO command now

123
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,538
shows me what variables I

124
00:04:52,538 --> 00:04:54,605
have in my Octave workspace.

125
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:56,310
So Who shows me whether

126
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,952
the variables that Octave has in memory currently.

127
00:04:59,952 --> 00:05:01,367
Features X and Price Y

128
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,991
are among them, as well as

129
00:05:02,991 --> 00:05:04,120
the variables that, you know,

130
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,311
we created earlier in this session.

131
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:09,198
So I can type Features X

132
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:11,062
to display features X. And

133
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:14,164
there's my data.

134
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,419
And I can type size features

135
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:18,022
X and that's my

136
00:05:18,022 --> 00:05:20,519
47 by two matrix.

137
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,307
And some of these size, press

138
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,729
Y, that gives me

139
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:26,753
my 47 by one vector.

140
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:30,125
This is a 47 dimensional vector.

141
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,080
This is all common vector that

142
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,231
has all the prices Y in my training set.

143
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,584
Now the who function shows

144
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,086
you one of the variables that, in the current workspace.

145
00:05:40,086 --> 00:05:42,195
There's also the who S

146
00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:45,369
variable that gives you the detailed view.

147
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:47,252
And so this also, with

148
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,574
an S at the end this also

149
00:05:48,574 --> 00:05:49,979
lists my variables except that it

150
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,782
now lists the sizes as well.

151
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,759
So A is a three by

152
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,764
two matrix and features

153
00:05:54,764 --> 00:05:56,545
X as a 47 by 2 matrix.

154
00:05:56,545 --> 00:05:59,327
Price Y is a 47 by one matrix.

155
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:01,098
Meaning this is just a vector.

156
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,438
And it shows, you know, how many bytes of memory it's taking up.

157
00:06:03,438 --> 00:06:06,020
As well as what type of data this is.

158
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,765
Double means double position floating

159
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:08,915
point so that just means that

160
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:13,148
these are real values, the floating point numbers.

161
00:06:13,148 --> 00:06:14,190
Now if you want to get

162
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,316
rid of a variable you can use the clear command.

163
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,124
So clear features X and type whose again.

164
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,448
You notice that the features X

165
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:26,465
variable has now disappeared.

166
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,567
And how do we save data?

167
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:29,221
Let's see.

168
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:30,411
Let's take the variable V and

169
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:33,075
say that it's a price Y 1 colon 10.

170
00:06:33,075 --> 00:06:34,826
This sets V to be

171
00:06:34,826 --> 00:06:38,574
the first 10 elements of

172
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,215
vector Y. So let's type who or whose.

173
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,612
Whereas Y was a 47 by 1 vector.

174
00:06:46,612 --> 00:06:48,474
V is now 10 by 1.

175
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,809
B equals price Y, one

176
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:52,451
column ten that sets it

177
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:53,520
to the just the first ten

178
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,705
elements of Y. Let's say

179
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:57,398
I wanna save this to date to disc

180
00:06:57,398 --> 00:07:00,129
the command save, hello.mat

181
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,302
V. This will

182
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,357
save the variable V into

183
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,690
a file called hello.mat.

184
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,490
So let's do that.

185
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,965
And now a file

186
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,181
has appeared on my Desktop, you

187
00:07:13,181 --> 00:07:15,066
know, called Hello.mat.

188
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:16,509
I happen to have MATLAB installed

189
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,962
in this window, which is why,

190
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:19,711
you know, this icon looks

191
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:21,621
like this because Windows is recognized

192
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:23,559
as it's a MATLAB file,but don't

193
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:24,882
worry about it if this file

194
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,051
looks like it has a different

195
00:07:26,051 --> 00:07:28,778
icon on your machine and

196
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:31,017
let's say I clear all my variables.

197
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,602
So, if you type clear without

198
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:36,061
anything then this actually deletes all of the variables in your workspace.

199
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,078
So there's now nothing left in the workspace.

200
00:07:39,078 --> 00:07:41,856
And if I load hello.mat,

201
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:44,388
I can now load back my

202
00:07:44,388 --> 00:07:46,054
variable v, which is

203
00:07:46,054 --> 00:07:47,830
the data that I

204
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,035
previously saved into the hello.mat file.

205
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:54,636
So, hello.mat, what we did just now to save hello.mat

206
00:07:54,636 --> 00:07:55,877
to view, this save the

207
00:07:55,877 --> 00:07:57,811
data in a binary format,

208
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,702
a somewhat more compressed binary format.

209
00:07:59,702 --> 00:08:01,077
So if v is a lot

210
00:08:01,077 --> 00:08:03,899
of data, this, you know, will be somewhat more compressing.

211
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:05,645
Will take off less the space.

212
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,784
If you want to save your

213
00:08:06,784 --> 00:08:08,959
data in a human readable

214
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,870
format then you type save hello.text

215
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,055
the variable v and then -ascii.

216
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,083
So, this will save

217
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,787
it as a text

218
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,352
or as ascii format of text.

219
00:08:21,352 --> 00:08:22,802
And now, once I've done

220
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,973
that, I have this file.

221
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:26,115
Hello.text has just

222
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,463
appeared on my desktop, and

223
00:08:28,463 --> 00:08:29,951
if I open this up, we

224
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,016
see that this is a text

225
00:08:31,016 --> 00:08:33,958
file with my data saved away.

226
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,698
So that's how you load and save data.

227
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:38,832
Now let's talk a bit about how to manipulate data.

228
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:40,526
Let's set a equals to that

229
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:44,910
matrix again so is my three by two matrix.

230
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,778
So as indexing.

231
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:48,493
So type A 3, 2.

232
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:51,219
This indexes into

233
00:08:51,219 --> 00:08:52,917
the 3, 2 elements of

234
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:54,308
the matrix A. So, this

235
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,320
is what, you know,

236
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,488
in normally, we will write this

237
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,421
as a subscript 3, 2

238
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,280
or A subscript,

239
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,320
you know, 3, 2

240
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,028
and so that's the element and

241
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:08,664
third row and second column

242
00:09:08,664 --> 00:09:11,539
of A which is the element of six.

243
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,820
I can also type A to

244
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,770
comma colon to fetch

245
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,851
everything in the second row.

246
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:22,806
So, the colon means every

247
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:27,381
element along that row or column.

248
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,274
So, a of 2 comma

249
00:09:29,274 --> 00:09:32,425
colon is this second row of a. Right.

250
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,662
And similarly, if I do a colon comma 2

251
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,262
then this means get everything in

252
00:09:38,262 --> 00:09:41,328
the second column of A. So, this gives me 2 4 6.

253
00:09:41,328 --> 00:09:42,921
Right this means of

254
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,467
A.  everything, second column.

255
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,967
So, this is my second

256
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,636
column A, which is 2 4 6.

257
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,267
Now, you can also

258
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,148
use somewhat most of the sophisticated index in the operations.

259
00:09:54,148 --> 00:09:56,575
So So, we just click each of an example.

260
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,537
You do this maybe less often,

261
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,231
but let me do this A 1 3 comma colon.

262
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:03,471
This means get all of

263
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,444
the elements of A who's first indexes one or three.

264
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,765
This means I get everything from

265
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:10,588
the first and third rows of

266
00:10:10,603 --> 00:10:12,780
A and from all

267
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,240
columns.

268
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:16,430
So, this was the

269
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,260
matrix A and so A

270
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,872
1 3 comma colon means get

271
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,222
everything from the first row

272
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,023
and from the second row and

273
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:27,172
from the third row and the

274
00:10:27,172 --> 00:10:28,313
colon means, you know, one both

275
00:10:28,313 --> 00:10:29,585
of first and the second

276
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:31,045
columns and so this

277
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:32,842
gives me this 1 2 5 6.

278
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:34,353
Although, you use the source

279
00:10:34,353 --> 00:10:37,182
of more subscript index

280
00:10:37,182 --> 00:10:39,819
operations maybe somewhat less often.

281
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,453
To show you what else we can do.

282
00:10:41,453 --> 00:10:43,617
Here's the A matrix and this

283
00:10:43,617 --> 00:10:47,276
source A colon, to give me the second column.

284
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:49,773
You can also use this to do assignments.

285
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:51,178
So I can take the second column of

286
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,949
A and assign that to

287
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,605
10, 11, 12, and

288
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,084
if I do that I'm now, you

289
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,220
know, taking the second column of

290
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,768
a and I'm assigning this column vector 10, 11, 12 to it.

291
00:11:02,768 --> 00:11:05,440
So, now a is this matrix that's 1, 3, 5.

292
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,760
And the second column has been replaced by 10, 11, 12.

293
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:14,513
And here's another operation.

294
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,917
Let's set A to be equal

295
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:17,738
to A comma 100, 101,

296
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,605
102 like so and what

297
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:24,109
this will do is

298
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,025
depend another column vector

299
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:29,855
to the right.

300
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,230
So, now, oops.

301
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,798
I think I made a little mistake.

302
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,065
Should have put semicolons there

303
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,910
and now A is equals to this.

304
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,564
Okay?

305
00:11:44,564 --> 00:11:45,479
I hope that makes sense.

306
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:46,480
So this 100, 101, 102.

307
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,804
This is a column vector

308
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,668
and what we did

309
00:11:51,668 --> 00:11:53,386
was we set A, take

310
00:11:53,386 --> 00:11:56,156
A and set it to the original definition.

311
00:11:56,156 --> 00:11:57,368
And then we put that column

312
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,192
vector to the right

313
00:11:59,192 --> 00:12:00,217
and so, we ended up taking

314
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:04,288
the matrix A and--which was

315
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:05,405
these six elements on the left.

316
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:06,785
So we took matrix

317
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,564
A and we appended another

318
00:12:08,564 --> 00:12:09,793
column vector to the right;

319
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:11,814
which is now why A is

320
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:16,083
a three by three matrix that looks like that.

321
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,005
And finally, one neat

322
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,802
trick that I sometimes use

323
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,022
if you do just a and just a colon like so.

324
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:25,585
This is a somewhat special case syntax.

325
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,695
What this means is that put all elements with A into

326
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:30,751
a single column vector

327
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,513
and this gives me a 9 by 1 vector.

328
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:38,584
They adjust the other ones are combined together.

329
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:45,258
Just a couple more examples. Let's see. Let's

330
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:52,073
say I set A to be equal to 123456, okay?

331
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:54,035
And let's say

332
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,674
I set a B to B

333
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,984
equal to 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

334
00:12:58,984 --> 00:13:00,346
I can create a new

335
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,161
matrix C as A B.

336
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,010
This just means my

337
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,666
Matrix A. Here's my Matrix

338
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,426
B and I've set C

339
00:13:08,426 --> 00:13:11,053
to be equal to AB.

340
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,225
What I'm doing is I'm taking

341
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:15,438
these two matrices and just concatenating onto each other.

342
00:13:15,438 --> 00:13:18,408
So the left, matrix A on the left.

343
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,786
And I have the matrix B on the right.

344
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,738
And that's how I formed

345
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,145
this matrix C by putting them together.

346
00:13:27,145 --> 00:13:28,927
I can also do C equals

347
00:13:28,927 --> 00:13:31,975
A semicolon B. The semi

348
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,552
colon notation means that

349
00:13:35,552 --> 00:13:38,881
I go put the next thing at the bottom.

350
00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:39,880
So, I'll do is a

351
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,169
equals semicolon B. It also

352
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,408
puts the matrices A

353
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,048
and B together except that it

354
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:46,408
now puts them on top of each other.

355
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,675
so now I have A on top and B at the bottom and C here

356
00:13:49,675 --> 00:13:52,038
is now in 6 by 2 matrix.

357
00:13:52,038 --> 00:13:54,263
So, just say the semicolon

358
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,705
thing usually means, you know, go to the next line.

359
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:58,463
So, C is comprised by a

360
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,598
and then go to the bottom

361
00:13:59,598 --> 00:14:00,610
of that and then put b

362
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,320
in the bottom and by the

363
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,225
way, this A B is

364
00:14:04,225 --> 00:14:05,734
the same as A, B and

365
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,106
so you know, either of these gives you the same result.

366
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,916
So, with that, hopefully you

367
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,256
now know how to construct

368
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,207
matrices and hopefully starts

369
00:14:17,207 --> 00:14:18,223
to show you some of the

370
00:14:18,223 --> 00:14:19,822
commands that you use

371
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,913
to quickly put together matrices and

372
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,390
take matrices and, you know,

373
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,984
slam them together to form

374
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,009
bigger matrices, and with

375
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:28,962
just a few lines of code, Octave

376
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:30,770
is very convenient in terms

377
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,683
of how quickly we can assemble

378
00:14:32,683 --> 00:14:36,033
complex matrices and move data around.

379
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,027
So that's it for moving data around.

380
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:39,347
In the next video we'll start

381
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:40,783
to talk about how to actually

382
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:46,232
do complex computations on this, on our data.

383
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,256
So, hopefully that gives you

384
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:49,961
a sense of how, with

385
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:51,049
just a few commands, you can

386
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:54,573
very quickly move data around in Octave.

387
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,164
You know, you load and save vectors and

388
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,059
matrices, load and save data,

389
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,201
put together matrices to create

390
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:02,990
bigger matrices, index into or select

391
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,021
specific elements on the matrices.

392
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:06,015
I know I went through a lot

393
00:15:06,015 --> 00:15:06,944
of commands, so I think

394
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,244
the best thing for you to do

395
00:15:08,244 --> 00:15:09,741
is afterward, to look

396
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:12,248
at the transcript of the things I was typing.

397
00:15:12,248 --> 00:15:13,286
You know, look at it.

398
00:15:13,286 --> 00:15:14,661
Look at the coursework site and download

399
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:15,927
the transcript of the session

400
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,479
from there and look through

401
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:18,820
the transcript and type some

402
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,942
of those commands into Octave yourself

403
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:24,752
and start to play with these commands and get it to work.

404
00:15:24,752 --> 00:15:28,113
And obviously, you know, there's no point at all to try to memorize all these commands.

405
00:15:28,113 --> 00:15:30,030
It's just, but what you

406
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,852
should do is, hopefully from

407
00:15:31,852 --> 00:15:32,910
this video you have gotten a

408
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:35,065
sense of the sorts of things you can do.

409
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,519
So that when later on when

410
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,902
you are trying to program a learning

411
00:15:37,902 --> 00:15:39,630
algorithms yourself, if you

412
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,921
are trying to find a specific

413
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,455
command that maybe you think

414
00:15:42,455 --> 00:15:43,878
Octave can do because you think

415
00:15:43,878 --> 00:15:45,325
you might have seen it here, you

416
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:47,300
should refer to the transcript

417
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,545
of the session and look through

418
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,693
that in order to find the commands you wanna use.

419
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:53,069
So, that's it for

420
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:54,841
moving data around and in

421
00:15:54,841 --> 00:15:56,060
the next video what I'd like

422
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,699
to do is start to tell

423
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,257
you how to actually do

424
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:01,404
complex computations on our

425
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,548
data, and how to

426
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,866
compute on the data, and

427
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:06,560
actually start to implement learning algorithms.
