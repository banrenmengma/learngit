1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,178
In this video, I'd like to

2
00:00:01,178 --> 00:00:02,587
tell you how to write

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,842
control statements for your

4
00:00:03,842 --> 00:00:05,672
Octave programs, so things

5
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,280
like "for", "while" and "if" statements

6
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,176
and also how to define and use functions.

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,980
Here's my Octave window. Let

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,502
me first show you how to use a "for" loop.

9
00:00:16,502 --> 00:00:17,888
I'm going to start by setting v

10
00:00:17,888 --> 00:00:18,852
to be a 10 by

11
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,808
1 vector 0.

12
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,209
Now, here's I write

13
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,071
a "for" loop for I equals 1 to 10.

14
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,608
That's for I equals Y colon 10.

15
00:00:27,608 --> 00:00:29,905
And let's see, I'm

16
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,466
going to set V of I

17
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:33,214
equals two to the

18
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,848
power of I, and finally

19
00:00:36,848 --> 00:00:37,671
end.

20
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,082
The white space does not matter,

21
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,538
so I am putting the spaces

22
00:00:40,538 --> 00:00:41,960
just to make it look nicely indented,

23
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,385
but you know spacing doesn't matter.

24
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,163
But if I do this, then the

25
00:00:46,163 --> 00:00:48,626
result is that V gets

26
00:00:48,626 --> 00:00:49,420
set to, you know, two to

27
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,478
the power one, two to the power two, and so on.

28
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,665
So this is syntax for I

29
00:00:52,665 --> 00:00:55,410
equals one colon 10 that

30
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,429
makes I loop through the

31
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,662
values one through 10.

32
00:00:59,662 --> 00:01:00,830
And by the way, you can also do

33
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,481
this by setting your

34
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:04,795
indices equals one to

35
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,260
10, and so the

36
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,305
indices in the array from one to 10.

37
00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:13,249
You can also write for I equals indices.

38
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,805
And this is actually the same as if I equals one to 10.

39
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,459
You can do, you know, display

40
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,498
I and this would do the same thing.

41
00:01:23,498 --> 00:01:24,698
So, that is a "for" loop,

42
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:27,201
if you are familiar with "break"

43
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,375
and "continue", there's "break" and

44
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:30,809
"continue" statements, you can

45
00:01:30,809 --> 00:01:32,061
also use those inside loops

46
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:33,902
in octave, but first

47
00:01:33,902 --> 00:01:36,550
let me show you how a while loop works.

48
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,088
So, here's my vector

49
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,912
V. Let's write the while loop.

50
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,037
I equals 1, while I

51
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,259
is less than or equal to

52
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:47,662
5, let's set

53
00:01:47,662 --> 00:01:51,082
V I equals one hundred

54
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,449
and increment I by

55
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:56,644
one, end.

56
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,090
So this says what?

57
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,932
I starts off equal to

58
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,359
one and then I'm going

59
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,629
to set V I equals one

60
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:04,249
hundred and increment I by

61
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,666
one until I is, you know, greater than five.

62
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,377
And as a result of that,

63
00:02:09,377 --> 00:02:13,022
whereas previously V was this powers of two vector.

64
00:02:13,022 --> 00:02:14,573
I've now taken the first

65
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,225
five elements of my vector

66
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,618
and overwritten them with this value one hundred.

67
00:02:19,618 --> 00:02:22,797
So that's a syntax for a while loop.

68
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,503
Let's do another example.

69
00:02:24,503 --> 00:02:26,600
Y equals one while

70
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,491
true and here

71
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,892
I wanted to show you how to use a break statement.

72
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:34,040
Let's say V I equals 999

73
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,331
and I equals i+1

74
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:45,900
if i equals 6 break and

75
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,910
end.

76
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,425
And this is also our first

77
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:51,945
use of an if statement, so

78
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:53,308
I hope the logic of this makes sense.

79
00:02:53,308 --> 00:02:57,297
Since I equals one and, you know, increment loop.

80
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,900
While repeatedly set V I equals 1

81
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,527
and increment i by 1,

82
00:03:01,527 --> 00:03:02,901
and then when 1 i

83
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,451
gets up to 6, do a

84
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,757
break which breaks here although

85
00:03:05,757 --> 00:03:07,284
the while do and so, the

86
00:03:07,284 --> 00:03:08,596
effective is should be to take

87
00:03:08,596 --> 00:03:09,929
the first five elements of this

88
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:11,748
vector V and set them to 999.

89
00:03:11,748 --> 00:03:14,832
And yes, indeed, we're taking

90
00:03:14,832 --> 00:03:18,345
V and overwritten the first five elements with 999.

91
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:20,172
So, this is the

92
00:03:20,172 --> 00:03:21,974
syntax for "if" statements, and

93
00:03:21,974 --> 00:03:25,058
for "while" statement, and notice the end.

94
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,159
We have two ends here.

95
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,719
This ends here ends the if statement

96
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,228
and the second end here ends the while statement.

97
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,265
Now let me show you the more general syntax for

98
00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:37,763
how to use an if-else statement.

99
00:03:37,763 --> 00:03:40,274
So, let's see, V 1

100
00:03:40,274 --> 00:03:42,776
is equal to 999, let's

101
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,996
type V1 equals to 2 for this example.

102
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,758
So, let me type

103
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:55,050
if V 1 equals 1 display the value as one.

104
00:03:56,855 --> 00:03:58,588
Here's how you write an else

105
00:03:58,588 --> 00:04:00,040
statement, or rather here's an

106
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,853
else if: V 1 equals

107
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:07,815
2. This is, if in case that's true in our example, display

108
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:12,268
the value as 2, else

109
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,960
display, the value is not one or two.

110
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,699
Okay, so that's a  if-else

111
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,889
if-else statement it ends.

112
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,271
And of course, here we've just

113
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:27,589
set v 1 equals 2, so hopefully, yup,

114
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,729
displays that the value is 2.

115
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,844
And finally, I don't

116
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,143
think I talked about this earlier, but

117
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:35,622
if you ever need to exit Octave,

118
00:04:35,622 --> 00:04:36,947
you can type the exit command and

119
00:04:36,947 --> 00:04:38,373
you hit enter that will cause Octave

120
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,981
to quit or the 'q'--quits

121
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:42,428
command also works.

122
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,857
Finally, let's talk about

123
00:04:43,857 --> 00:04:45,292
functions and how to define

124
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,592
them and how to use them.

125
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,680
Here's my desktop, and I

126
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,078
have predefined a file

127
00:04:52,078 --> 00:04:56,818
or pre-saved on my desktop a file called "squarethisnumber.m".

128
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,471
This is how you define functions in Octave.

129
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,681
You create a file called, you know,

130
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:03,958
with your function name and then ending in .m,

131
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,694
and when Octave finds

132
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,643
this file, it knows that this

133
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,322
where it should look for the definition of the function "squarethisnumber.m".

134
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,076
Let's open up this file.

135
00:05:14,076 --> 00:05:15,717
Notice that I'm using the

136
00:05:15,717 --> 00:05:19,352
Microsoft program Wordpad to open up this file.

137
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:20,250
I just want to encourage you, if

138
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,379
your using Microsoft Windows, to

139
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:25,075
use Wordpad rather than

140
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,477
Notepad to open up these

141
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,557
files, if you have a

142
00:05:28,557 --> 00:05:29,938
different text editor that's fine

143
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:33,325
too, but notepad sometimes messes up the spacing.

144
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,775
If you only have Notepad, that should

145
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,312
work too, that could work

146
00:05:36,312 --> 00:05:37,779
too, but if you

147
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:39,354
have Wordpad as well, I

148
00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:40,609
would rather use that or some

149
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:45,053
other text editor, if you have a different text editor for editing your functions.

150
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,155
So, here's how you define the function in Octave.

151
00:05:47,155 --> 00:05:49,816
Let me just zoom in a little bit.

152
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,516
And this file has just three lines in it.

153
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:54,440
The first line says function Y equals square root

154
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,448
number of X, this tells

155
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:57,705
Octave that I'm gonna return

156
00:05:57,705 --> 00:06:00,025
the value Y, I'm gonna

157
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:01,315
return one value and that

158
00:06:01,315 --> 00:06:02,375
the value is going to

159
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,443
be saved in the variable Y

160
00:06:04,443 --> 00:06:06,003
and moreover, it tells Octave

161
00:06:06,003 --> 00:06:08,068
that this function has one argument,

162
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,408
which is the argument X,

163
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,846
and the way the function

164
00:06:11,846 --> 00:06:15,156
body is defined, if Y equals X squared.

165
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,553
So, let's try to call

166
00:06:16,553 --> 00:06:19,071
this function "square", this number

167
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:21,854
5, and this actually

168
00:06:21,854 --> 00:06:23,115
isn't going to work, and

169
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:25,693
Octave says square this number it's undefined.

170
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:28,902
That's because Octave doesn't know where to find this file.

171
00:06:28,902 --> 00:06:30,682
So as usual, let's use PWD,

172
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,592
or not in my directory,

173
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:36,151
so let's see this c:\users\ang\desktop.

174
00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:39,888
That's where my desktop is.

175
00:06:39,888 --> 00:06:41,276
Oops, a little typo there.

176
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,848
Users ANG desktop

177
00:06:42,848 --> 00:06:44,157
and if I now type square

178
00:06:44,157 --> 00:06:46,728
root number 5, it returns the

179
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:48,505
answer 25.

180
00:06:48,505 --> 00:06:50,347
As kind of an advanced feature, this

181
00:06:50,347 --> 00:06:51,972
is only for those of you

182
00:06:51,972 --> 00:06:54,596
that know what the term search path means.

183
00:06:54,596 --> 00:06:55,945
But so if you

184
00:06:55,945 --> 00:06:57,497
want to modify the Octave

185
00:06:57,497 --> 00:06:58,863
search path and you

186
00:06:58,863 --> 00:06:59,866
could, you just think of

187
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:01,827
this next part as advanced

188
00:07:01,827 --> 00:07:03,292
or optional material.

189
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,214
Only for those who are either

190
00:07:04,214 --> 00:07:05,484
familiar with the concepts of

191
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:07,642
search paths and permit languages,

192
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,962
but you can use the

193
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:11,875
term addpath, safety colon,

194
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,241
slash users/ANG/desktop to

195
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:17,972
add that directory to the

196
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:19,744
Octave search path so that

197
00:07:19,744 --> 00:07:21,065
even if you know, go to

198
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,611
some other directory I can

199
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:24,510
still, Octave still knows

200
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,005
to look in the users ANG

201
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:29,214
desktop directory for functions

202
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:30,521
so that even though I'm in

203
00:07:30,521 --> 00:07:31,868
a different directory now, it still

204
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,297
knows where to find the square this number function.

205
00:07:35,297 --> 00:07:35,935
Okay?

206
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,407
But if you're not familiar

207
00:07:37,407 --> 00:07:39,184
with the concept of search path, don't worry

208
00:07:39,184 --> 00:07:40,068
about it.

209
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:40,889
Just make sure as you use

210
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:42,053
the CD command to go to

211
00:07:42,053 --> 00:07:43,926
the directory of your function before

212
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,441
you run it and that actually works just fine.

213
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:49,587
One concept that Octave has

214
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,058
that many other programming

215
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:52,969
languages don't is that it

216
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:54,909
can also let you define

217
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:58,873
functions that return multiple values or multiple arguments.

218
00:07:58,873 --> 00:08:00,889
So here's an example of that.

219
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:02,931
Define the function called square

220
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:04,964
and cube this number X

221
00:08:04,964 --> 00:08:06,644
and what this says is this

222
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,547
function returns 2 values, y1 and y2.

223
00:08:08,547 --> 00:08:09,955
When I set down, this

224
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,603
follows, y1 is squared, y2 is execute.

225
00:08:13,603 --> 00:08:16,972
And what this does is this really returns 2 numbers.

226
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,855
So, some of you depending

227
00:08:18,855 --> 00:08:20,195
on what programming language you use,

228
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:22,931
if you're familiar with, you know, CC++ your offer.

229
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,051
Often, we think of the function as return in just one value.

230
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:27,847
But just so the syntax in Octave

231
00:08:27,847 --> 00:08:31,679
that should return multiple values.

232
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,087
Now back in the Octave window. If

233
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:37,914
I type, you know, a, b equals

234
00:08:37,914 --> 00:08:41,263
square and cube this

235
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:44,599
number 5 then

236
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:46,338
a is now equal to

237
00:08:46,338 --> 00:08:47,778
25 and b is equal to

238
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,729
the cube of 5 equal to 125.

239
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,645
So, this is often

240
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,010
convenient if you needed to define

241
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,447
a function that returns multiple values.

242
00:08:56,447 --> 00:08:57,480
Finally, I'm going to show

243
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,123
you just one more sophisticated example of a function.

244
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,361
Let's say I have a data set

245
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,400
that looks like this, with data points at 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3.

246
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,636
And what I'd like

247
00:09:07,636 --> 00:09:09,113
to do is to define an

248
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:10,798
octave function to compute the cost

249
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:14,341
function J of theta for different values of theta.

250
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,157
First let's put the data into octave.

251
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,694
So I set my design

252
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,998
matrix to be 1,1,1,2,1,3.

253
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,043
So, this is my design

254
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,073
matrix x with x0, the

255
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:27,428
first column being the said

256
00:09:27,428 --> 00:09:28,746
term and the second term being

257
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,375
you know, my the x-values of my three training examples.

258
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,594
And let me set

259
00:09:33,594 --> 00:09:35,488
y to be 1-2-3 as

260
00:09:35,488 --> 00:09:38,793
follows, which were the y axis values.

261
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,431
So let's say theta

262
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:43,714
is equal to 0 semicolon 1.

263
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,652
Here at my desktop, I've

264
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,483
predefined does cost function

265
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,008
j and if I

266
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,019
bring up the definition of that function it looks as follows.

267
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:53,579
So function j equals cost function

268
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,192
j equals x y

269
00:09:55,192 --> 00:09:57,151
theta, some commons, specifying

270
00:09:57,151 --> 00:09:59,546
the inputs and then

271
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,383
vary few steps set m

272
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:02,995
to be the number trading examples

273
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,495
thus the number of rows in x.

274
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,596
Compute the predictions, predictions equals

275
00:10:07,596 --> 00:10:10,137
x times theta and so

276
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,670
this is a common that's wrapped

277
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,693
around, so this is probably the preceding comment line.

278
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,823
Computer script errors by, you know, taking

279
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:18,637
the difference between your predictions and

280
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,265
the y values and taking the

281
00:10:20,265 --> 00:10:22,126
element of y squaring and then

282
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,376
finally computing the cost

283
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:26,128
function J. And Octave knows

284
00:10:26,128 --> 00:10:27,439
that J is a value I

285
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:31,383
want to return because J appeared here in the function definition.

286
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,127
Feel free by the way to pause

287
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,292
this video if you want

288
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:36,712
to look at this function

289
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:38,820
definition for longer and

290
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,031
kind of make sure that you understand the different steps.

291
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:45,184
But when I run it in

292
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:46,630
Octave, I run j equals

293
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:51,197
cost function j x y theta.

294
00:10:51,197 --> 00:10:55,142
It computes. Oops, made a typo there.

295
00:10:55,142 --> 00:10:57,018
It should have been capital X. It

296
00:10:57,018 --> 00:11:00,472
computes J equals 0 because

297
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,367
if my data set was,

298
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:06,963
you know, 123, 123 then setting, theta 0

299
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,741
equals 0, theta 1 equals

300
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,259
1, this gives me exactly the

301
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:15,559
45-degree line that fits my data set perfectly.

302
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,887
Whereas in contrast if I set

303
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:19,828
theta equals say 0, 0,

304
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,524
then this hypothesis is

305
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,050
predicting zeroes on everything

306
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,803
the same, theta 0 equals 0,

307
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,139
theta 1 equals 0 and

308
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:29,345
I compute the cost function

309
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,830
then it's 2.333 and that's

310
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,495
actually equal to 1 squared,

311
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,745
which is my squared error on

312
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:39,789
the first example, plus 2 squared,

313
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,377
plus 3 squared and then

314
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,288
divided by 2m, which is

315
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,091
2 times number of training examples,

316
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:50,643
which is indeed 2.33 and

317
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,289
so, that sanity checks that

318
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,909
this function here is, you

319
00:11:54,909 --> 00:11:56,302
know, computing the correct cost

320
00:11:56,302 --> 00:11:58,212
function and these are the couple examples

321
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,222
we tried out on our

322
00:12:00,222 --> 00:12:03,433
simple training example.

323
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,914
And so that sanity tracks

324
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,689
that the cost function J,

325
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,202
as defined here, that it

326
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,992
is indeed, you know, seeming to compute

327
00:12:12,992 --> 00:12:14,908
the correct cost function, at least

328
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,424
on our simple training set

329
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,835
that we had here with X

330
00:12:18,835 --> 00:12:20,823
and Y being this

331
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:25,189
simple training example that we solved.

332
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,285
So, now you know how

333
00:12:26,285 --> 00:12:28,171
to right control statements like for loops,

334
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:29,838
while loops and if statements

335
00:12:29,838 --> 00:12:33,197
in octave as well as how to define and use functions.

336
00:12:33,197 --> 00:12:34,530
In the next video, I'm

337
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,123
going to just very quickly

338
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,144
step you through the logistics

339
00:12:38,144 --> 00:12:39,873
of working on and

340
00:12:39,873 --> 00:12:41,664
submitting problem sets for

341
00:12:41,664 --> 00:12:45,212
this class and how to use our submission system.

342
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,794
And finally, after that, in

343
00:12:46,794 --> 00:12:48,856
the final octave tutorial video,

344
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:51,400
I wanna tell you about vectorization, which

345
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,938
is an idea for how to

346
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,126
make your octave programs run much fast.
