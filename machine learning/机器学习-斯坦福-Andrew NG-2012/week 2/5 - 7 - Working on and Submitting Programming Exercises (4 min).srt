00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,162
In this video, I want to just quickly step you
through the logistics of how to work on

2
00:00:04,162 --> 00:00:09,387
homeworks in this class and how to use the
submission system which will let you verify

3
00:00:09,387 --> 00:00:15,619
right away that you got the right answer for
your machine learning program exercise.

4
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:19,354
Here's my Octave window and
let's first go to my desktop.

5
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:25,374
I saved the files for my first exercise,
some of the files on my desktop:

6
00:00:25,374 --> 00:00:27,994
in this directory, 'ml-class-ex1'.

7
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:32,921
And we provide a number files
and ask you to edit some of them.

8
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:40,701
So the first file should meet the details in
the pdf file for this programming exercise.

9
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:45,352
But one of the files we ask you to edit is
this file called warmUpExercise.m, where the

10
00:00:45,352 --> 00:00:49,890
exercise is really just to make sure that
you're familiar with the submission system.

11
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,795
And all you need to do is
return the 5x5 identity matrix.

12
00:00:53,795 --> 00:01:00,301
So the solution to this exercise I just
showed you is to write A = eye(5).

13
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:05,766
So that modifies this function to
generate the 5x5 identity matrix.

14
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:11,149
And this function warmUpExercise()
now returns the 5x5 identity matrix.

15
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:13,727
And I'm just going to save it.

16
00:01:13,727 --> 00:01:17,465
So I've done the first part of this homework.
Going back to my Octave window,

17
00:01:17,465 --> 00:01:27,185
let's now go to my directory,
'C:\Users\ang\Desktop\ml-class-ex1'.

18
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:33,347
And if I want to make sure that I've implemented
this, type 'warmUpExercise()' like so.

19
00:01:33,347 --> 00:01:39,671
And yup, it returns the 5x5 identity matrix
that we just wrote the code to create.

20
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:43,870
And I can now submit the code as follows.
I'm going to type 'submit()' in this

21
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:49,300
directory and I'm ready to submit part 1
so I'm going to enter choice '1'.

22
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,387
So it asks me for my email address.
I'm going go to the course website.

23
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:59,682
This is an internal testing site, so your version
of the website may look a little bit different.

24
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:07,934
But that's my email address and this is my submission
password, and I'm just going to type them in here.

25
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:19,205
So I have ang@cs.stanford.edu and
my submission password is 9yC75USsGf.

26
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:23,849
I'm going to hit enter; it connects to the server
and submits it, and right away

27
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:28,567
it tells you "Congratulations! You have
successfully completed Homework 1 Part 1".

28
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:33,160
And this gives you a verification
that you got this part right.

29
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,795
And if you don't submit the right answer,
then it will give you a message indicating

30
00:02:36,795 --> 00:02:39,501
that you haven't quite gotten it right yet.

31
00:02:39,501 --> 00:02:47,861
And you can use this submission password and
you can generate new passwords; it doesn't matter.

32
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:52,556
But you can also use your regular website
login password, but because this password

33
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:59,281
here is typed in clear text on your monitor,
we gave you this extra submission password

34
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:03,650
in case you don't want to type in your
website's normal password onto a window

35
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:09,219
that, depending on your operating system,
may or may not appear as text when you type

36
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:14,544
it into the Octave submission script.

37
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:18,746
So, that's how you submit the
homeworks after you've done it.

38
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:23,696
Good luck, and, when you get around to
homeworks, I hope you get all of them right.

39
00:03:23,696 --> 00:03:28,329
And finally, in the next and final Octave
tutorial video, I want to tell you about

40
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:33,337
vectorization, which is a way to get your
Octave code to run much more efficiently.
