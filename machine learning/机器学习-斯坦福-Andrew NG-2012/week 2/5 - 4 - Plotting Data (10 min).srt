1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,402
When developing learning algorithms, very

2
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:04,066
often a few simple plots

3
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:05,279
can give you a better

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,593
sense of what the algorithm

5
00:00:06,593 --> 00:00:08,423
is doing and just sanity check

6
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:09,503
that everything is going okay

7
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,405
and the algorithms doing what is supposed to.

8
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,924
For example, in an earlier

9
00:00:13,924 --> 00:00:15,244
video, I talked about how

10
00:00:15,244 --> 00:00:16,826
plotting the cost function J

11
00:00:16,826 --> 00:00:18,433
of theta can help you

12
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:21,383
make sure that gradient descent is converging.

13
00:00:21,383 --> 00:00:23,084
Often, plots of the data

14
00:00:23,084 --> 00:00:24,795
or of all the learning algorithm outputs

15
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,422
will also give you ideas

16
00:00:26,422 --> 00:00:29,391
for how to improve your learning algorithm.

17
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:31,312
Fortunately, Octave has very

18
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,045
simple tools to generate lots

19
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,534
of different plots and when

20
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,518
I use learning algorithms, I find

21
00:00:36,518 --> 00:00:38,082
that plotting the data, plotting

22
00:00:38,082 --> 00:00:40,175
the learning algorithm and so

23
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:42,057
on are often an important

24
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,165
part of how I get

25
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:45,937
ideas for improving the

26
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,199
algorithms and in this video,

27
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:48,482
I'd like to show you some

28
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:52,773
of these Octave tools for plotting and visualizing your data.

29
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,301
Here's my Octave window.

30
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:57,471
Let's quickly generate some data

31
00:00:57,471 --> 00:00:58,646
for us to plot.

32
00:00:58,646 --> 00:00:59,724
So I'm going to set T

33
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,181
to be equal to, you know, this array of numbers.

34
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,828
Here's T, set of

35
00:01:03,828 --> 00:01:06,685
numbers going from 0 up to .98.

36
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,048
Let's set y1 equals sine

37
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,340
of 2 pie 40 and

38
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,102
if I want to plot the sine function, it's very easy.

39
00:01:16,102 --> 00:01:17,918
I just type plot T comma Y

40
00:01:17,918 --> 00:01:20,304
1 and hit enter.

41
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,233
And up comes this plot

42
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:24,270
where the horizontal axis is

43
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,515
the T variable and the vertical

44
00:01:25,515 --> 00:01:26,946
axis is y1, which

45
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,577
is the sine you saw in the function that we just computed.

46
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,281
Let's set y2 to be

47
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:34,401
equal to the cosine

48
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:38,735
of two pi, four T, like so.

49
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,403
And if I plot

50
00:01:41,403 --> 00:01:43,835
T comma y2, what octave

51
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:45,045
will I do is I'll take my

52
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,988
sine plot and it

53
00:01:46,988 --> 00:01:48,681
will replace with this cosine

54
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,322
function and now, you know, cosine of xi of 1.

55
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,006
Now, what if I

56
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,581
want to have both

57
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,981
the sine and the cosine plots on top of each other?

58
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,702
What I'm going to do is I'm

59
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,164
going to type plot t,y1.

60
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:03,332
So here's my sine function, and then

61
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:06,958
I'm going to use the function hold on.

62
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:08,908
And what hold does it closes

63
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,247
octaves to now

64
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,490
figures on top of the

65
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,772
old one and let

66
00:02:13,772 --> 00:02:15,249
me now plot t y2.

67
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:19,812
I'm going to plot the cosine function in a different color.

68
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,166
So, let me put there

69
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,093
r in quotation marks there

70
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:25,339
and instead of replacing

71
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:26,615
the current figure, I'll plot the

72
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,499
cosine function on top and

73
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:32,915
the r indicates the what is an event color.

74
00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:35,166
And here additional commands - x

75
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:39,157
label times, to label the X axis, or the horizontal axis.

76
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,451
And Y label values A,

77
00:02:41,451 --> 00:02:44,688
to label the vertical axis value,

78
00:02:44,688 --> 00:02:47,032
and I can also

79
00:02:54,532 --> 00:02:57,616
label my two lines

80
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,514
with this command: legend sine cosine

81
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,860
and this puts this

82
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,125
legend up on the upper

83
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,122
right showing what the 2

84
00:03:05,122 --> 00:03:08,285
lines are, and finally title

85
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,753
my plot is the title at the top of this figure.

86
00:03:12,753 --> 00:03:13,835
Lastly, if you want to save

87
00:03:13,835 --> 00:03:18,197
this figure, you type print -dpng

88
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,128
myplot

89
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:21,505
.png.

90
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:23,292
So PNG is a graphics

91
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:25,170
file format, and if you

92
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,612
do this it will let you save this as a file.

93
00:03:27,612 --> 00:03:28,902
If I do that,

94
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,287
let me actually change directory to,

95
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,114
let's see, like

96
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,180
that, and then I will print that out.

97
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,692
So this will take a

98
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,869
while depending on how

99
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,193
your Octave configuration is setup,

100
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,891
may take a few seconds, but change

101
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,730
directory to my desktop and Octave

102
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,943
is now taking a few seconds to save this.

103
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,635
If I now go to my desktop, Let's hide these windows.

104
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,358
Here's myplot.png

105
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,720
which Octave has saved, and you

106
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,481
know, there's the figure saved as the PNG file.

107
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:05,530
Octave can save thousand other formats as well.

108
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,468
So, you can type help plot,

109
00:04:07,468 --> 00:04:09,497
if you want to see the

110
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,512
other file formats, rather than

111
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,377
PNG, that you can save

112
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:15,149
figures in.

113
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:16,471
And lastly, if you want

114
00:04:16,471 --> 00:04:18,507
to get rid of the plot, the

115
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,867
close command causes the figure to go away.

116
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:24,963
As I figure if I type

117
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:26,628
close, that figure just

118
00:04:26,628 --> 00:04:30,153
disappeared from my desktop.

119
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,372
Octave also lets you specify a figure and numbers.

120
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:36,935
You type figure 1 plots t, y1.

121
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:39,582
That starts up

122
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,959
first figure, and that plots t, y1.

123
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,075
And then if you want a second figure, you specify a different figure number.

124
00:04:45,075 --> 00:04:47,765
So figure two, plot t,

125
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,924
y2 like so, and

126
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:53,084
now on my desktop, I actually have 2 figures.

127
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,625
So, figure 1 and figure

128
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:55,874
2 thus 1 plotting the sine

129
00:04:55,874 --> 00:04:59,169
function, 1 plotting the cosine function.

130
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,498
Here's one other neat command that

131
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:02,825
I often use, which is the subplot command.

132
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:05,401
So, we're going to use subplot 1 2 1.

133
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:07,958
What it does it sub-divides

134
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:11,200
the plot into a

135
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,760
one-by-two grid with the

136
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,010
first 2 parameters are, and

137
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,607
it starts to access the

138
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,335
first element. That's

139
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,714
what the final parameter 1 is, right?

140
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:23,568
So, divide my figure into a

141
00:05:23,568 --> 00:05:24,913
one by two grid, and I

142
00:05:24,913 --> 00:05:26,585
want to access the first

143
00:05:26,585 --> 00:05:27,948
element right now.

144
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,435
And so, if I type that

145
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:32,722
in, this product, this figure, is on the left.

146
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,291
And if I plot t,

147
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,682
y1, it now fills

148
00:05:37,682 --> 00:05:40,462
up this first element.

149
00:05:40,462 --> 00:05:42,565
And if I I'll do subplot 122.

150
00:05:42,565 --> 00:05:44,456
I'm going to start to

151
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:48,724
access the second element and plot t, y2.

152
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,323
Well, throw in y2 in

153
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:54,875
the right hand side, or in the second element.

154
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,114
And last command, you can

155
00:05:56,114 --> 00:05:58,165
also change the axis scales

156
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:00,308
and change axis these to 1.51

157
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,892
minus 1 1 and this

158
00:06:02,892 --> 00:06:05,071
sets the x range

159
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:07,448
and y range for the

160
00:06:07,448 --> 00:06:09,874
figure on the right,

161
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,381
and concretely, it assess the horizontal

162
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:13,668
major values in the figure

163
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,856
on the right to make sure 0.5

164
00:06:14,856 --> 00:06:16,334
to 1, and the vertical

165
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,572
axis values use the range from minus one to one.

166
00:06:19,572 --> 00:06:21,736
And, you know, you don't need to memorize all these commands.

167
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:23,178
If you ever need to

168
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:24,773
change the access or you

169
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,703
need to know is that, you know, there's an

170
00:06:25,703 --> 00:06:26,628
access command and you can

171
00:06:26,628 --> 00:06:28,364
already get the details

172
00:06:28,364 --> 00:06:31,590
from the usual octave help command.

173
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,861
Finally, just a couple last

174
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:35,449
commands CLF clear is

175
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,362
a figure and here's one unique trait.

176
00:06:38,362 --> 00:06:39,772
Let's set a to be equal

177
00:06:39,772 --> 00:06:42,076
to a 5 by 5

178
00:06:42,076 --> 00:06:43,375
magic squares a. So, a

179
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,290
is now this 5 by 5

180
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,581
matrix does a neat

181
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:49,341
trick that I sometimes use to

182
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,582
visualize the matrix, which is

183
00:06:51,582 --> 00:06:54,792
I can use image sc

184
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,362
of a what this will

185
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,056
do is plot a five

186
00:06:58,056 --> 00:07:03,925
by five matrix, a five by five grid of color.

187
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:05,739
where the different colors correspond to

188
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:09,011
the different values in the A matrix.

189
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,262
So concretely, I can also do color bar.

190
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,903
Let me use a

191
00:07:14,903 --> 00:07:16,715
more sophisticated command, and image sc

192
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:19,608
A color bar

193
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:22,454
color map gray.

194
00:07:22,454 --> 00:07:24,757
This is actually running three commands at a time.

195
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,286
I'm running image sc then running

196
00:07:26,286 --> 00:07:28,943
color bar, then running color map gray.

197
00:07:28,943 --> 00:07:30,142
And what this does, is it sets

198
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,355
a color map, so a

199
00:07:31,355 --> 00:07:32,749
gray color map, and on the

200
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:35,333
right it also puts in this color bar.

201
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,525
And so this color bar

202
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,701
shows what the different shades of color correspond to.

203
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,704
Concretely, the upper left

204
00:07:42,704 --> 00:07:44,494
element of the A matrix

205
00:07:44,494 --> 00:07:46,358
is 17, and so that corresponds

206
00:07:46,358 --> 00:07:49,297
to kind of a mint shade of gray.

207
00:07:49,297 --> 00:07:52,012
Whereas in contrast the second

208
00:07:52,012 --> 00:07:53,210
element of A--sort of the

209
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,640
1 2 element of A--is 24.

210
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,716
Right, so it's A 1 2 is 24.

211
00:07:57,716 --> 00:07:59,683
So that corresponds to

212
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,343
this square out here, which is

213
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,677
nearly a shade of white.

214
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:05,640
And the small value, say

215
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,657
A--what is that? A

216
00:08:08,657 --> 00:08:12,260
4 5, you know, is a value

217
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,346
3 over here that corresponds--

218
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,548
you can see on my color bar

219
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:16,618
that it corresponds to a

220
00:08:16,618 --> 00:08:19,499
much darker shade in this image.

221
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,141
So here's another example,

222
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:23,228
I can plot a larger, you

223
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,768
know, here's a magic 15 that

224
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,029
gives you a 15 by 15

225
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:27,675
magic square and this

226
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,504
gives me a plot of what

227
00:08:29,504 --> 00:08:33,675
my 15 by 15 magic squares values looks like.

228
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,225
And finally to wrap

229
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:37,075
up this video, what you've

230
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:38,318
seen me do here is

231
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:41,917
use comma chaining of function calls.

232
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,195
Here's how you actually do this.

233
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,638
If I type A equals

234
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,613
1, B equals 2, C equals

235
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:48,620
3, and hit Enter, then

236
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,628
this is actually carrying out

237
00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:52,039
three commands at the same time.

238
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,490
Or really carrying out three

239
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,849
commands, one after another,

240
00:08:55,849 --> 00:08:57,521
and it prints out all three results.

241
00:08:57,521 --> 00:08:58,417
And this is a lot like

242
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:00,489
A equals 1, B equals

243
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:01,755
2, C equals 3, except

244
00:09:01,755 --> 00:09:03,532
that if I use semicolons instead

245
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,854
of a comma, it doesn't print out anything.

246
00:09:05,854 --> 00:09:07,195
So, this, you know,

247
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,865
this thing here we call comma

248
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,185
chaining of commands, or comma chaining of function calls.

249
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,755
And, it's just another

250
00:09:13,755 --> 00:09:15,520
convenient way in Octave to

251
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,778
put multiple commands like image sc

252
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:19,358
color bar, colon map

253
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,919
to put multi-commands on the same line.

254
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,104
So, that's it.

255
00:09:24,104 --> 00:09:25,281
You now know how to plot

256
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:27,504
different figures and octave, and

257
00:09:27,504 --> 00:09:29,270
in next video the

258
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,430
next main piece that I want

259
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,985
to tell you about is how to

260
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:33,622
write control statements like if,

261
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,294
while, for statements and

262
00:09:35,294 --> 00:09:39,426
octave as well as hard to define and use functions
